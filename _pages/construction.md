This page describes the current status of the development of {{site.url}}.

There are three parallel activities underway:
1. Migration of blog content from my [old blog](http://home.badc.rl.ac.uk/lawrence),
2. Migration of "talks: and "pages" from the same place, and
3. Addition of functionality here.

#### Current Status

1. Functional with a few problems
    * Category pages are broken.

#### Underway

1. Tagging and categories
2. Migration from old blog.

#### Planned

1. Commenting
2. Migration to https

#### What's been done

1. Choice of blogging technology: [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) (after a number of false starts with other techologies).
1. Blog "theme/template" was based on [Steven Miller's Blog](https://svmiller.com), informed by Michael Rose's [So Simple Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme)
    * Thanks both!
2. Most recent talk and blog content has been migrated, plus a few bits and bobs from the past to make sure it all works.
