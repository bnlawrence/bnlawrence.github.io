I am not currently doing any under-graduate teaching (and haven't done so since
I left the University of Canterbury for my UK national lab position in 2000).

#### In the past

I started teaching as a graduate student when I taught both physics and mathematics at Christchurch Polytechnic. I also taught the "Sight and Hearing" 15 lecture module of PHYS105 at the University of Canterbury for two years as a grad student, and a 10 lecture module "Geophysical Fluid Dynamics" as part of PHYS454:Ionospheric and Space Physics.

While in my first stint in the UK I was involved in ad hoc tutoring of undergraduate physics at the University of Oxford before becoming a fellow at Lady Margaret Hall (LMH) whereupon my teaching duties became more significant. I was involved in most aspects of first year undergraduate teaching for LMH including selection of new entrants for the college.
As a lecturer at the University of Canterbury I taught:
*  PHYS226: Digital Electronics (24 lectures, 12 labs) An introduction to integrated circuits, computer hardware, and computer data acquisition
* PHYS316: Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (24 lectures, 6 tutorials). An introduction to elementary meteorology and the principles of fluid motion in a rotating coordinate system. The course covers gravity waves, planetary waves, the general circulation and the basic ideas of numerical weather prediction.
*  PHYS417B: Radar Remote Sensing (12 Lectures) Radar principles starting from fundamental electromagnetic theory through to the physics of radio-wave scattering from both clear air and the ionosphere.
* In addition I produced two lectures on Antarctic Ozone for an interdisciplinary first year course which I taught from 1997-2000.

In 1999 I began the development of the laboratory component of a new course: PHYS319: Advanced Electronics, but the work was not completed as I left the University of Canterbury to return to the U.K.

During my time at Canterbury I served on the teaching committee from in both 1998 and 1999 as supervisor of studies for the third year where my responsibilities included pastoral care, enrolment and career advice, along with coordination of assessment at the third year.

I also had a major role in course reorganisation within the department at Canterbury, steering major changes through the department and university committees in both 1998 and 1999. Also in 1998 and 1999 I was a prime instigator for the establishment of a Bachelor of Science and Technology degree in the University. When I left the University in April 2000 the new degree had not yet been established, but work was still progressing to introduce it at a later date.
