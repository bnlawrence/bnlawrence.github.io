<p>So I had got my custom domain (www.bnlawrence.net) set up and working on GitHub pages, but I wanted to serve it via https, rather than http. (It worked fine on github pages using https when it was bnlawrence.github.io, but the moment I made it bnlawrence.net, https was disabled. Github don’t support that :anguished:)</p>

<p>The only viable way to do what I want without intense configuration agony appeared to be to use <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/">cloudfare</a>, but I already had a domain registered at GoDaddy. This is how I did it.</p>

<p>I basically followed the instructions on <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/sections/200820158-Cloudflare-101">CloudFare101</a>, beginning at their <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/201720164-Step-2-Create-a-Cloudflare-account-and-add-a-website">step-2</a>.</p>

<p>This step got my website known to them, and gave me some nameserver addresses which I needed for the next step.</p>

<p>This involved logging into GoDaddy … and then back to the CloudFare dashboard (see their <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/205195708">docs</a>).</p>
