Note that ISO690 [defines](http://www.collectionscanada.ca/iso/tc46sc9/standard/690-2e.htm#5.1) what is needed to make an electronic bibliographic citation. Note that "when available" takes precedence over "required" in what follows (i.e. if you don't have it you can't do it). ISO690 is expected to be used in "print", so is a content standard, and expects things to appear in order (when available) as follows: 
* To reference a whole document (or database), use:
    * Primary responsibility (Required)
    * Title (Required)
    * Type of medium (Required)
    * Subordinate responsibility (Optional)
    * Edition (Required)
    * Place of publication (Required)
    * Publisher (Required)
    * Date of publication (Required)
    * Date of update/revision (Required)
    * Date of citation (Required for online documents; Optional for others)
    * Series (Optional)
    * Notes (Optional)
    * Availability and access (Required for online documents; Optional for others)
    * Standard number (Required)
* To refrence a part of a document, all the above, plus 
    * (after date of citation) 
Chapter or equivalent designation (of part) (Required)
    * Title (of part) (Required)
    * Numeration within host document (Optional)
    * Location within host document (Required)
