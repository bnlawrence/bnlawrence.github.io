    <p>Since 2006 I’ve been recording my significant talks here.</p>
<div class="talks">

<div class="meeting">
<h1 class="theader"> European Big Data Value Forum</h1>
<h1 class="tdetails">Versailles, November, 2017</h1>
<h2 id="the-data-deluge-in-high-resolution-climate-and-weather-simulation">The Data Deluge in High Resolution Climate and Weather Simulation</h2>

<p>Presentation: <a href="http://bnlawrence.github.io//assets/talks/171122_HPC_Bigdata_Joussaume_VF.pdf">pdf</a> (5 MB).</p>

<p>This talk was given by Sylvie Joussaume, but we had worked on it together, so I think it’s fair enough to include here. We wanted to show the scale of the data problems we have in climate science, and some of the direction in which we are moving with respect to “big data” technologies and algorithms.</p>

</div>

<div class="meeting">
<h1 class="theader"> Science and the Digital Revolution -  Data, Standards, and Integration</h1>
<h1 class="tdetails">Royal Society, London, November, 2017</h1>
<h2 id="data-interoperability-and-integration-a-climate-modelling-perspective-november-2017">Data Interoperability and Integration: A climate modelling perspective, November 2017</h2>

<p>Presentation: <a href="http://bnlawrence.github.io//assets/talks/2017-11-14-171104_data_interop_lawrence.pdf">pdf</a> (11.5 MB).</p>

<p>I was asked to give a talk at a <a href="http://www.codata.org/">CODATA</a> meeting which was aimed at developing a roadmap for:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Mobilising community support and advice for discipline-based initiatives to develop online data capacities and services;</li>
  <li>Priorities for work on interdisciplinary data integration and flagship projects;</li>
  <li>Approaches to funding and coordination; and</li>
  <li>Issues of international data governance.</li>
</ol>

<p>For this talk I was asked to address an example from the WMO research community on what we have accomplished in standardising a range of things, and reflecting on what has worked/failed and why.  I wasn’t given much time to prepare, so this is what they got!</p>

<div class="meeting">
<h1 class="theader"> Gung Ho Network Meeting</h1>
<h1 class="tdetails">Exeter University, July 2017</h1>
<h2 id="performance-portability-productivity-which-two-do-you-want">Performance, Portability, Productivity: Which two do you want?</h2>

<p>Presentation: <a href="http://bnlawrence.github.io//assets/talks/2017-07-18-ppp4_gungho.pdf">pdf</a> (4 MB).</p>

<p>I talked about two papers that I’ve recently been involved with: “CPMIP: measurement of real computational performance of Earth System Models in CMIP6” (which appeared in early 2017) and “Crossing the Chasm: How to develop weather
and climate models for next generation computers?” which at the time was just about to be submitted to GMD.</p>

</div>

<div class="meeting">
<h1 class="theader"> International Supercomputing (ISC) and JASMIN User Conferences</h1>
<h1 class="tdetails">Frankfurt and Didcot, June 2017</h1>
<p>I gave two versions of this talk, one at at the International Supercomputing Conference’s Workshop on HPC I/O in the data centre, and one at the 2017 JASMIN User’s Conference.</p>

<p>The talk covered the structure and usage of JASMIN, showing there is a lot of data movement both in the batch system and the interactive environment.  One key observation was that we cannot afford to carry on with parallel disk, and we don’t think tape alone is a solution, so we are investigating object stores, and
object store interfaces.</p>

<p>Presentation: <a href="http://bnlawrence.github.io//assets/talks/2016-10-13-lawrence_infrastructure.pdf">pdf</a> (18 MB).</p>

<p>This was a talk given at a NERC Town Hall meeting on the future of data centres in London, on the 13th of October 2016.  My brief was to talk about underlying infrastructure, which I did here by discussing the relationship between scientific data workflows and the sort of things we do with JASMIN.</p>

<h1 class="theader"> Meteorology meets Computer Science Symposium</h1>
<h1 class="tdetails">University of Reading, September 2016</h1>

<p>Presentation: <a href="http://bnlawrence.github.io//assets/talks/2016-09-15-lawrence.pdf">pdf</a> (14 MB).</p>

<p>This was a talk at a University of Reading symposium held with Tony Hey, Geoffrey Fox  and Jeff Dozier as guest speakers as part of the introduction o the new Computer Science Department in the Reading University School of Mathematical, Physical and Computer Sciences <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/smpcs-home.aspx">SMPCS</a>.</p>

<p>The main aim of my talk was to get across the wide range of interesting generic science and engineering challenges we face in delivering the infrastructure needed for environmental science.</p>

<h1 class="tdetails">Annecy, September, 2015</h1>
<h2 id="uk-academic-infrastructure-to-support-big-environmental-science">UK academic infrastructure to support (big) environmental science</h2>

<p>Presentation: <a href="http://bnlawrence.github.io//assets/talks/2015-09-14-lawrence_icas15.pdf">pdf</a> (18 MB).</p>

<p>Abstract:  Modern environmental science requires the fusion of ever growing volumes of data from multiple simulation and observational platforms. In the UK we are investing in the infrastructure necessary to provide the generation, management, and analysis of the relevant datasets. This talk discusses the existing and planned hardware and software infrastructure required to support the (primarily) UK academic community in this endeavour, and relates it to key international endeavours at the European and global scale – including earth observation programmes such as the Copernicus Sentinel missions, the European Network for Earth Simulation, and the Earth System Grid Federation.</p>

<div class="meeting">
<h1 class="theader"> Big Data and Extreme-Scale Computing (BDEC)</h1>
<h1 class="tdetails">Barcelona, January, 2015</h1>
<p>There were two back to back meetings organised as part of the 2015 Big Data and Extreme Computing meeting <a href="http://www.exascale.org/bdec/agenda/barcelona">website</a>.  In the first, organised as part of the European Exascale Software Initiative (EESI), I gave a full talk, in the second, I provided a four page position paper with a four page exposition.</p>

<h2 id="it-starts-and-ends-with-data-towards-exascale-from-an-earth-system-science-perspective">It starts and Ends with Data: Towards exascale from an earth system science perspective</h2>

<p>Presentation: <a href="http://bnlawrence.github.io//assets/talks/2015-01-28-Lawrence_EESI2015.pdf">pdf</a> (7 MB).</p>

<p>Six sections: the big picture, background trends, hardware issues, software issues, workflow, and a summary.</p>

<h2 id="bringing-compute-to-the-data">Bringing Compute to the Data</h2>

<p>Presentation: <a href="http://bnlawrence.github.io//assets/talks/2015-01-30-Lawrence_4slides.pdf">pdf</a> (3 MB).</p>

<p>This was my main BDEC contribution. There was also a four page
summary paper: <a href="http://bnlawrence.github.io//assets/papers/Law15.pdf">pdf</a>.</p>

<h1 class="theader"> IS-ENES2 Kickoff Meeting</h1>

<h2 id="the-future-of-esgf-in-the-context-of-enes-and-is-enes2">The Future of ESGF in the context of ENES and IS-ENES2</h2>

<p>Presentation: <a href="http://bnlawrence.github.io//assets/talks/2013-05-28-lawrence-isenes2-kickoff.pdf">pdf</a> (2MB).</p>

<p>I probably tried to do too much in this talk. There were three subtexts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>We as a community have too much data to handle, and I mentioned the apocryphal estimate that only 2/3 of data written is read … but I confused folks … that figure applies to institutional data, not data in ESGF …</li>
  <li>That the migration of data and information between domains (see the talk) requires a lot of effort, and that (nearly) no one recognises or funds that effort (kudos to KNMI :-),</li>
  <li>That portals are easy to build, but hard to build right, and maybe we need fewer, or maybe we need more, but either way, they need to <em>both</em> meet requirements in technical functionality, and information (as opposed to data) content.</li>
</ol>

<p>Presentation: <a href="http://bnlawrence.github.io//assets/talks/2006-04-26-nerc-escience-ahm.ppt">pdf</a> (5 MB).</p>

<p>In this presentation, I present some of the motivation for the <a href="http://ndg.nerc.ac.uk">NERC DataGrid</a> development (the key points being that we want semantic access to distributed data with no centralised user management), link it to the ISO TC211 standards work, and take the listener through a tour of some of the NDG products as they are now. There is a slightly more detailed look at the Climate Sciences Modelling Language, and I conclude with an overview of the NDG roadmap.</p>
