After some months in public review, our paper introducing a formal data model for the Climate Forecast (CF) conventions (Hassell, Gregory, Blower, Lawrence, &amp; Taylor, 2017) has appeared in Geoscientific Model Development. Although CF was developed for content stored in NetCDF files, this data model has been developed in such a way that the logic can be used for CF content stored in other formats."

      "excerpt"		: "It is no secret that much of the progress in climate system modelling in recent decades has been on the back of the (then) inexorable increase in computational power associated with Moore’s Law - much of which came for free as chips got faster. However, now they’re not so much getting faster as we will get more processors and more processor types, and we have to be smarter about how we programme for them (Lawrence et al., n.d.). This is a problem for all of science!The US, Japan and China have been working on the problem for a while, and Europe is rapidly trying to catch up, but the “exascale problem” is all but invisible in the UK. While it’s obviously unfeasible for the UK to build an exascale computer on their own in the current economic and political climate, it’s absolutely the case that UK science and industry will have to work out how to use exascale computing, not least because the tools and techniques will percolate down eventually. However, even before the percolation, UK will have to exploit exascale computing to remain competitive, so what will that entail for us?"

After all, in a world where there is very little new money in real terms (or even none), an increase in one part of the budget needs to be offset elsewhere. So, the real consequence of these increases in storage cost have to be decreases in the amount of science done (fewer staff/instruments/computers), and that’s unpalatable even if it’s unavoidable. At the moment many choose to think it is avoidable, which is quite a feasible position if you’re an ostrich, but not so good if you’re responsible for delivering science!"

The roadmap to PRIMAVERAPresentation: pdf (37 MB).Abstract:Recent results and plans from the Joint Met Office/NERC High Resolution Climate Modelling programme are presented, along with a summary of recent and planned model developments. We show the influence of high resolution on a number of important atmospheric phenomena, highlighting both the roles of multiple groups in the work and the need for further resolution and complexity improvements in multiple models. We introduce plans for a project to do just that. A final point is that this work is highly demanding of both the supercomputing and subsequent analysis environments.Infrastructure for Environmental Supercomputing: beyond the HPC!Abstract:We begin by motivating the problems facing us in environmental simulations across scales: complex community interactions, and complex infrastructure. Looking forward we see the drive to increased resolution and complexity leading not only to compute issues, but even more severe data storage and handling issues. We worry about the software consequences before moving to the only possible solution, more and better collaboration, with shared infrastructure. To make progress requires moving past consideration of software interfaces alone to consider also the “collaboration” interfaces. We spend considerable time describing the JASMIN HPC data collaboration environment in the UK, before reaching the final conclusion: Getting our models to run on (new) supercomputers is hard. Getting them to run perfomantly is hard. Analysing, exploiting and archiving the data is (probably) now even harder!Presentation:  pdf (22 MB )"

Michael Tobis is arguing that a modernprogramming language and new tools will make a big difference. Me, I’mnot so sure. I’m with Gavin.So here is my perspective on why it’s hard. It is of necessitya bit of an abstract argument …  We need to start with the modelling process itself. We have a physicalsystem with components within it.  Each physical component needs to bedeveloped independently, checked independently … This is a scientific, thena computational, then a diagnostic problem.  Each component needs to talk to other components, so there needs to be acommunication infrastructure which couples components. Michael has criticisedESMF (and by implication PRISM and OASIS etc), but regardless of how you doit, you need a coupling framework. This is a computational problem. I thinkit’s harder than Michael thinks it is. Those ESMF and PRISM folks are notstupid …  All those independently checked components may behave in different ways whencoupled to other components (their interactions are nonlinear). Understandingthose interactions takes time. This is a scientific and diagnostic problem.  We need a dynamical core. It needs to be fast, efficient, mass preserving,and stable in a computational sense. Stability is a big problem, given thatthe various parameterisations will perturb it in ways that are quiteinstability inducing. This is both a mathematical and a computationalproblem.  We need to worry about memory. We need to worry a lot about memory actually.If in our discussion we’re going to get excited about scalability inmulti-core environments, then yes, I can have 80 (pick a number) cores on mychip, but can I have enough memory and memory bandwidth to exploit them? Howdo we distribute our memory around our cores?  What about I/O bandwidth? Without great care, the really big memory hungryclimate models can often get slowed up and be waiting spinning empty CPUcycles waiting for I/O. This is a computational problem."

There are a lot of issues, some of which have been addressed before, by projects, like for example a German pilot experiment. The way I see it, things we haveto address include:  How do we deal with dataset transience? My first reaction to this question was to say that one has to make dataset publication final - if one wants to change the dataset, one should publish a new version. However, it doesn’t take long to realise that while that might make sense for datasets that are in some way canonical, it isn’t a general solution. Many scientific datasets are subject to more or less continual revision as more data is collected (for example, covering a wider spatial or temporal domain), or data is revised as quality control is improved.  In the case of most of our data, the latter situation should result in revised datasets - which was the situation I had envisaged - but in a gene database for example, that doesn’t make nearly as much sense if one plans to cite the database, which one expects to change as new sequences are added and old ones revised. This leads us to  How do we cite something within a database/dataset? Here I think the answer is that database contents should be thought of consisting of features in the OGC/ISO sense; that is, of objects which are instances of some named class which is well defined (with the class definition being well described and lodged in some registry). In that case, all such instance objects should be described by a unique identifier and thus citeable in some way. However, it is important that as such instances are revised/improved/replaced, not only do the new instances carry new identifiers, but the old instances must carry information that they are obsolete.  What metadata is needed to publish a dataset (as opposed to, say, a book)?In the ndg project, we have been investigating metadata, and we think there are at least four categories of metadata, one needs to deal with, which we have briefly summarised as:          A (for Archive): what you need to understand the format and direct content (i.e. what quantities are actually stored).      B (for Browse): what you need to understand the context of the data, and to allow you to choose between otherwise similar datasets (hence Browse).      C (for Character or Citation): what you need to support annotation of the data.      D (For Discovery): what you need to find the datasets  - broadly similar to the catalogue records in a library, but enhanced because we’re dealing with data.        If substantial amounts of metadata are needed, how do we deal with the definition of authorship for datasets? In the four categories above, one might expect the data originator to supply A, and some of the B metadata, but in reality it is rare for a dataset collector to provide enough B metadata … they have too much institutional wisdom which they fail to encode. Hence, to my mind, dataset publication will involve significant efforts from third parties (not the collector, nor necessarily, the publisher), and that effort will be in the form of material which were it in a standalone document, would be reflected with coauthorship … I think however, for data, we need a recognised categories of authorship which clearly delineate between the collector/compiler, and the metadata creators, but which reflect the academic aspirations of both.  If we want reputable data citation systems, how do we deal with refereeing?Clearly we (the BADC) could publish datasets ourselves, and indeed, we intend to do so, however, what guarantee of quality will our users get? Obviously we can do internal quality control, but that can only deal with compliance of the data to some schema, e.g. it has the right metadata, the numbers are within bounds, etc. What we can’t do, and what we need refereeing for is to comment authoritatively on, for examples:          the suitability of using a particular instrument to make a specific measurement, or      the suitability of a particular algorithm for combining data.        How do we deal with persistence of the digital objects that we cite?This is a whole topic in itself, but all objects which we expect to be citable, have to have identifiers which are live as long as the objects, and in particular, are independent of the storage mechanism, or the interfaces."

The following schematic outlines a model of a possible transaction I could have with some data."

By using low-altitude winds from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) Re-Analysis from 1979-1994 (ERA-15) to predict theareas of maximum likelihood of orographic wave generation, it is shown that much of the deficiency is likely to be due to the lack ofa representation of the orographic cirrus generated by sub-grid scale orography.

It’s not yet obvious why … but as a consequence we’ve had to have some backup plans for whatwould happen if eXist failed to deliver for us. One of our backup planswas to keep an eye on the Berkely DB XML project. We didn’t use it initially because we wanted to exploitxquery. Well, now, with version 2.07 announced (see previous link), it supports xquery, so no doubt we’ll be testing it in the coming months.It’s very pleasing that there are already suse rpms."

The key thing I discovered were someinconsistencies in the spec  why does the trackback have (uri,excerpt) but the rss response have(link,description)?  how extensible is it? I want to put some semantics in my trackbackping … to tell the target what sort of trackback is coming in (it might notbe a blog, it might be an analysis programme, or a formal citation).Thinking this must be a bit of old hat for the semantic web folks, I went off on a bit of a google on trackback and semantics."
