  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Some time ago our European project Metafor migrated to a global project called <a href="http://es-doc.org">es-doc</a>.   During the metafor project we put a lot of effort into trying to develop materials which describe what it is trying to achieve,  but I think we never really got that right (despite a number of papers on the subject - e.g. <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-5-1493-2012">Lawrence et al 2012 </a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-11-00035.1">Guilyardi et al 2013</a> etc).</p>

<p>I’m currently in the process of trying to produce a figure on the subject for another publication, and in the process have produced these, which I think might be quite useful for understanding what es-doc is trying to document, and what the main kinds of documentation are that it produces. I’d be interested in feedback as to whether these figures are helpful or not.</p>

<p>In each figure, the boxes and links are not meant to correspond directly to the UML classes and associations of the (es-doc) Common Information Model (although some do) - the intention is to describe the concepts and intent of the various pieces of documentation.</p>

<h4 id="figure-one">Figure One</h4>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2014-07-09-MIPprocess_esdoc.jpg" alt="Figure One" /></p>

<p>The MIPS process involves designing <strong>experiment</strong>s which are provided to modelling centres.</p>

<p>Modelling centres configure model code to produce a <strong>configured model</strong>.</p>

<p>They then run one (or many) <strong>Simulation</strong>s to support one or more experiments. The Simulation will conformTo (NumericalRequirements) of the Experiment, and will produce Output<strong>Data</strong>, and was run on a <strong>Platform</strong>.</p>

<p>The output data is uploaded to the ESGF archive where is supports the MIP.</p>

<p>Each of the coloured boxes represents an <em>es-doc</em> “document-type”.</p>

<h4 id="figure-two">Figure Two</h4>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2014-07-09-simple_esdoc.jpg" alt="Figure Two" /></p>

<p>Neglecting the process, we can look at the various document types and what they are for in more detail.</p>

<p>A simulation (which can also be an aggregation of simulations, also known as an ensemble) will have used some input data, some of which may have been defined and/or constrained by one of the numerical requirements of the experiment.</p>

<p>Constraints on the simulation by the numerical requirements might require conformances - which define how those constraints affect either the data or the code (maybe a choice of a particular code modification, or via a specific parameter choice or choices).</p>

<p>Configured models are described by their Science Properties.</p>

<p>A Simulation document will include all the information coloured in yellow, so it will define which configured model was used via the <strong>uses</strong> relationship, which will point to configured model document, which itself describes the model.</p>

<p>Similarly, an experiment document will define all the various numerical requirements, and may point to some specific input data requirements.</p>

<p>Ideally output data objects will point back at the simulation which produced them.</p>

<h4 id="figure-three">Figure Three</h4>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2014-07-09-Simulations_esdoc.jpg" alt="Figure Three" /></p>

<p>In even more detail we can see that numerical requirements come in a number of flavours, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SpatioTemporalConstraints - which might define required experimental start dates, durations, and/or the coverage (global, regional etc).</li>
  <li>Forcings - which generally define how various aspects of the system might be represented, for example, providing Ozone files for a consistent static ozone representation.</li>
  <li>OutputRequirements - which define what output is required for intercomparison.</li>
</ul>

<p>Simulation conformances are generally linked to specific numerical requirements and consist of data and code-mod conformances.</p>

<p>ConfiguredModels are configured from BaseModel code (this is not currently implemented in es-doc). In principle they can be described both by their software properties and the science properties (and so can their sub-components).</p>

<p>The run-time performance of the simulation should also be captured by resource and performance characteristics (but this too is not yet supported by es-doc).</p>

<p>A model description document should include all the material in green, including the links.</p>

<p><em><a href="/computing/2014/07/updated_version_of_the_model_documentation_plots/">Updated version of the model documentation plots</a> (from “Bryan’s Blog” on (on Tuesday 29 July, 2014)</em>)I’ve had some feedback, and some more thinking, so here are three updated versions of those plots…</p>

<h4 id="comments-2">comments (2)</h4>
<p><em>Rupert Ford (on Wednesday 09 July, 2014)</em>
Hi Bryan, Should Resources and Performance sit off Platform? I would have said that they are properties of the simulation when run on a platform. So Simulation used Resources on Platform and Simulation ranWith Performance on Platform. As you said, it is not UML so perhaps it does not matter!</p>

<p><em>Bryan (on Wednesday 09 July, 2014)</em>
Agreed.  Resource and Performance are properties of a Simulation.</p>
