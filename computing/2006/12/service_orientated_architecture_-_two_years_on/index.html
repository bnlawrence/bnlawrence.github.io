  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I’ve been blogging for slightly over two years. After I wrote my SOA
article earlier today, I realised that my <a href="/computing/2004/12/SOA/">second ever blog post</a> was on SOA. <a href="http://savas.parastatidis.name/2004/12/19/d5f3232e-759a-4064-8685-22bc8fe1f5df.aspx">Then</a>, as <a href="http://savas.parastatidis.name/2006/12/02/1dd88c4b-0336-48be-94d2-424f57af3b8b.aspx">now</a>, I had been reading <a href="http://savas.parastatidis.name">Savas’s blog</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in the intervening time two things have happened:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I have spent more and more time down the SOA hole, to the detriment of my Atmospheric Science, and</li>
  <li>I forgot this:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Share schema and contract, not type (avoid the baggage of explit type, allow the things on either end to implement them how they like).
</blockquote>

<p>This was in a discussion of distributed objects versus service orientated architectures. I should have reread that entry and the links within (especially <a href="http://savas.parastatidis.name/2004/12/19/d5f3232e-759a-4064-8685-22bc8fe1f5df.aspx">this one</a>) before <a href="/computing/2006/12/no_silver_bullet_exists/">wading into deep waters</a>! It would have helped focus my argument.</p>

<p>Going back then we have from the <a href="http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,3e6852e9-26fb-4561-90c5-1357cbf026cd.aspx">original article that inspired my second blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>The motivation behind service-orientation is to reduce the coupling between applications.
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I’m not so sure about that, I think it’s really about what Lesley Wyborn in her SEEGRID III presentation called “decomposition” - and the reason why we want decomposition is so that we can have “orchestration”. So it’s actually about
reducing the coupling <strong>within</strong> applications so the components of application(s) can be reassembled to do new and interesting things - potentially across system and/or organisational boundaries. Having done so, we might still want strong typing (although <a href="http://hyperthink.net/blog/CommentView,guid,1c407222-5849-4fd0-a026-341633859105.aspx">this</a> paints an interesting perspective on typing and the use of xml schema).</p>

<p>Anyway, I need to get back to thinking about other activities here for a while and forget about SOA details. Fortunately Simon Cox sent me a photo which puts SOA in a proper perspective, and he’s kindly allowed me to put it up here:

<p>… there is a long tail of activities for which the abilities of web services to open up interoperabilty is being hindered by the difficulty in both service and data description …</p>

<p>Some very incomplete thoughts about your posting.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>SOA is very much oriented towards “enterprise”, not towards “mashup”. If we’re building for the enterprise, I suspect we may all have been better off sticking with CORBA and not relearning the same thing many different ways. Trouble is, personally, I’m not so interested in “enterprise”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more complex things are, the more strongly typed, the less you will see “reassembly to do new and interesting things”. That’s why there were no CORBA mashups, and I suspect there will be no SOA mashups.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe strong typing is a form of avoiding the difficult task of making data more accessible. It’s easier to throw a complex schema at someone and say “here, do something with this” than it is to figure out how to distill things down to a more user friendly representation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In perhaps one of the strangest suggestions I’ve ever seen, this guy at ZDnet thinks Steve Jobs should step in and “make SOA a hit”.</p>
