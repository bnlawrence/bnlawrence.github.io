  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I was asked to give a talk at this <a href="http://www.codata.org/">CODATA</a> meeting which was aimed at developing a roadmap for:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Mobilising community support and advice for discipline-based initiatives to develop online data capacities and services;</li>
  <li>Priorities for work on interdisciplinary data integration and flagship projects;</li>
  <li>Approaches to funding and coordination; and</li>
  <li>Issues of international data governance.</li>
</ol>

<p>Details of my talk are <a href="/talks/2017/11/data_interop_lawrence/">here</a>.
<!-- More -->
There were some other interesting talks, some of which resonated particularly with me, including</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.dataone.org/organization/executive-team/william-bill-michener">Bill Michener</a> talking about Dataone, and the importance of governance activities where all lines of responsibility are clear: no committees or panels whose remit is unclear or whose reporting lines are non-existent.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/chemistry/about/staff/jgf.page">Jeremy Fry</a> talking about digital infrastructure in support of (physical) chemistry, who had some thought provoking comments on creativity, “engrooved” bad habits (harking back to a talk by Paul Trowler, which I have yet to get a copy of) and the potential role of AI in scientific discovery:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote> Also, human creativity seems to depend increasingly on the stochasticity of previous experiences - particular life events that allow a researcher to notice something others do not. Although chance has always been a factor in scientific discovery, it is currently playing a much larger role than it should. *([The Atlantic, April 2017](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/04/can-scientific-discovery-be-automated/524136/))*.
* [Robert Hanisch](https://www.nist.gov/people/robert-hanisch)  talking about experience of the IAU in developing technical infrastructure, and in particular the governance of technical components for the International Virtual Observatory Alliance. The  [IVOA](http://www.ivoa.net/) attempts to follows the W3C governance model:
    * Data access protocols require two independent implementations.
    * Notes are promoted to Working Drafts, which become Proposed Recommendations, which get endorsed to become Recommendations, which eventually become standards &#151; although the did note that the formal endorsement step wasn't (yet?) in practice.
</blockquote>

<p>All communities reported difficulties in funding infrastructure at the sorts of levels necessary, and little or no investment in usability … funders like prototypes … but not boring maintenance and improvement … which means that sometimes scientific take-up falls far below what was envisaged.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I was not able to go to days one and three of this three day meeting.</p>
