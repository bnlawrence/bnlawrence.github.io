  abstract = {The JASMIN super-data-cluster is being deployed to support the data analysis requirements of the UK and European climate and earth system modelling community. Physical colocation of the core JASMIN resource with significant components of the facility for Climate and Environmental Monitoring from Space (CEMS) provides additional support for the earth observation community, as well as facilitating further comparison and evaluation of models with data. JASMIN and CEMS together centrally deploy 9.3 PB of storage - 4.6 PB of Panasas fast disk storage alongside the STFC Atlas Tape Store. Over 370 computing cores provide local computation. Remote JASMIN resources at Bristol, Leeds and Reading provide additional distributed storage and compute configured to support local workflow as a stepping stone to using the central JASMIN system. Fast network links from JASMIN provide reliable communication between the UK supercomputers MONSooN (at the Met Office) and HECToR (at the University of Edinburgh). JASMIN also supports European users via a light path to KNMI in the Netherlands. The functional components of the JASMIN infrastructure have been designed to support and integrate workflows for three main goals: (1) the efficient operation of data curation and facilitation at the STFC Centre for Environmental Data Archival; (2) efficient data analysis by the UK and European climate and earth system science communities, and; (3) flexible access for the climate impacts and earth observation communities to complex data and concomitant services.},

  abstract = {The Unified Model (UM) code supports simulation of weather, climate and earth system processes. It is primarily developed by the UK Met Office, but in recent years a wider community of users and developers have grown around the code. Here we present results from the optimisation work carried out by the UK National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) for a high resolution configuration (N512 \$$\backslash$approx\$ 25km) on the UK ARCHER supercomputer, a Cray XC-30. On ARCHER, we use Cray Performance Analysis Tools (CrayPAT) to analyse the performance of UM and then Cray Reveal to identify and parallelise serial loops using OpenMP directives. We compare performance of the optimised version at a range of scales, and with a range of optimisations, including altered MPI rank placement, and addition of OpenMP directives. It is seen that improvements in MPI configuration yield performance improvements of between 5 and 12$\backslash$\%, and the added OpenMP directives yield an additional 5-16$\backslash$\% speedup. We also identify further code optimisations which could yield yet greater improvement in performance. We note that speedup gained using addition of OpenMP directives does not result in improved performance on the IBM Power platform where much of the code has been developed. This suggests that performance gains on future heterogeneous architectures will be hard to port. Nonetheless, it is clear that the investment of months in analysis and optimisation has yielded performance gains that correspond to the saving of tens of millions of core-hours on current climate projects.},

deliver cost-effective world class science and impact from the exploitation of data. A \textsterling{}17M
investment is needed for the next generation of JASMIN, to maintain the UK's scientific and
competitive edge, facilitating the exploitation of world-class environmental science to meet the
global societal challenges of the future. Such an investment would build on international leadership
and would support:
\textbullet{} The merging of extremely large environmental data sets with the latest earth system models:
building downstream growth in space-based environmental services; and underpinning
international collaborations.
\textbullet{} The transformation of data into information products and services; JASMIN provides the
foundation for the UK environmental information ecosystem: investment will provide greater
access to knowledge for a range of users.
\textbullet{} Enabling researchers to better support government usage of environmental hazard data resulting
in large-scale societal benefit e.g. development of earthquake monitoring systems.
\textbullet{} The next generation of earth observation and environmental simulation, including for the
next phase of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) global model intercomparison
project (CMIP6) .
The updated JASMIN will deliver cost-effective, world-class environmental science, exploiting
data for societal benefit. It will be a cutting-edge novel computational environment, ensuring
highly-skilled people are retained in the UK from systems engineers to environmental data users,
from data scientists and analysts to mathematicians.},
