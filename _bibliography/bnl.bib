  abstract = {Twelve simulations of the stratosphere and mesosphere have been performed to investigate the near-major stratospheric warming of January 1992. All were initialized close to the observed warming. the resulting simulations fall into two classes: those that accurately reproduce the timing and anticyclonic merger mechanism of the observed warming and those that fail. the model used was a mechanistic stratosphere-mesosphere model. with a prescribed troposphere; thus differences among the simulations must only be due to differences among the initial conditions, which were constructed using different combinations of observed and climatological data. the main differences between the initial conditions of those simulations that succeed and those that fail are in low latitudes. A detailed analysis of two contrasting simulations reveals that the one which fails does not accurately reproduce the observed conveyor belt feeding tropical low-potential-vorticity (PV) air into the Aleutian high. Several factors appear to have combined to make the difference between the successful and the unsuccessful simulation of this sudden warming. the amount of low PV already present in higher latitudes in the initial condition appears to have an influence, as does the strength of the subtropical PV barrier. Also important is the Rossby wave structure which, by determining the degree of zonal asymmetry of the PV barrier, influences the injection of low PV into higher latitudes. In addition, however, we propose that the inertial stability of the tropical upper stratosphere might have played a significant role. In the unsuccessful simulation the tropical upper stratosphere is more inertially unstable than in the successful simulation; in this region more vigorous small-scale roll structures develop which, in stabilizing the flow, might have inhibited the northward transport of tropical air that appears to be a key part of the development of the observed sudden warming.},

  doi = {10.1029/95JE02486},
  abstract = {Gravity waves are disturbances whose restoring force is buoyancy. In the atmosphere they are made possible by the variation of potential temperature with height. They can be excited by various mechanisms including flow over orography. The momentum carried by these disturbances can exert significant drag forces on the mean flow in the terrestrial mesosphere. One parameterization of this effect, the Lindzen gravity wave drag scheme, is inserted into two simplified general circulation models (GCMs) of the Martian atmosphere, and its effects are described. The influence of large-amplitude, planetary-scale topography on wave breaking altitudes is discussed. We show that above 60 km in altitude, gravity wave drag dominates the momentum balance of the Martian atmosphere on the largest scales. This indirectly alters the thermal state of the atmosphere through the thermal wind relation. Model winds at this level are consistent with other, simpler studies, as well as with Earth-based spectroscopic observations. Below 60 km, the effects of planetary wave-mean flow interaction, as well as heating associated with Hadley circulation descent, are significant in determining the wind strength. Eddy diffusion coefficients derived from the Lindzen parameterization above 50 km are consistent with values implied from chemical modeling of the Martian middle atmosphere, as well as with simpler models of gravity wave drag.},

  title = {The Effect of Spatial Variations in Unresolved Topography on Gravity Wave Drag in the {{Martian}} Atmosphere},
  abstract = {Recent three dimensional simulations of the Martian atmosphere have shown that gravity wave drag is a large, and possibly dominant, term in the momentum balance above 50 km. In previous simulations, a constant value was used for the topographic variance on scales smaller than the model grid. Spatial variations in this quantity are now taken into account, and the results described. The topographic variance has its highest amplitude in the Tharsis and Hellas regions. Correspondingly, relatively low breaking levels are found here. Longitudinal variations in breaking levels and hence accelerations are very large, as are zonal asymmetries in zonal wind u. These asymmetries are expected to play a role in planetary wave propagation in the Martian middle atmosphere. Momentum balances are found to be dependent on nonlinear coupling terms in the momentum equations due to the high zonal winds and small planetary radius. At the equinoxes two regimes exist. One is where breaking levels are very low: here accelerations and eddy diffusion coefficients resulting from the parameterization of gravity wave breaking in the model are also very low. The other regime is where breaking levels are higher, and winds are stronger. In this region, vertical mixing is also very weak. These results give further credence to the idea that breaking thermal tides cause the intense vertical diffusion that has been inferred from observations at the Martian equinox.},

Initial JASMIN configuration and first experiences are reported here. Useful improvements in scientific workflow are presented. It is clear from the explosive growth in stored data and use that there was a pent up demand for a suitable big-data analysis environment.

  title = {Applying the {{Earth System Grid Security System}} in a {{Heterogeneous Environment}} of {{Data Access Services}}},
  volume = {12},
  abstract = {CEDA (Centre for Environmental Data Archival) based at STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory is host to
the BADC (British Atmospheric Data Centre) and NEODC (NERC Earth Observation Data Centre) with data
holdings of over half a Petabyte. In the coming months this figure is set to increase by over one Petabyte through
the BADC's role as one of three data centres to host the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5)
core archive of climate model data. Quite apart from the problem of managing the storage of such large volumes
there is the challenge of collating the data together from the modelling centres around the world and enabling
access to these data for the user community.
An infrastructure to support this is being developed under the US Earth System Grid (ESG) and related
projects bringing together participating organisations together in a federation. The ESG architecture defines
Gateways, the web interfaces that enable users to access data and data serving applications organised into Data
Nodes. The BADC has been working in collaboration with US Earth System Grid team and other partners to
develop a security system to restrict access to data. This provides single sign-on via both OpenID and PKI based
means and uses role based authorisation facilitated by SAML and OpenID based interfaces for attribute retrieval.
This presentation will provide an overview of the access control architecture and look at how this has been
implemented for CEDA.
CEDA has developed an expertise in data access and information services over several years through a
number of projects to develop and enhance these capabilities. Participation in CMIP5 comes at a time when a
number of other software development activities are coming to fruition. New services are in the process of being
deployed alongside services making up the system for ESG. The security system must apply access control across
this heterogeneous environment of different data services and technologies. One strand of the development efforts
within CEDA has been the NDG (NERC Datagrid) Security system. This system has been extended to interoperate
with ESG, greatly assisted by the standards based approach adopted for the ESG security architecture. Drawing
from experience from previous projects the decision was taken to refactor the NDG Security software into a
component based architecture to enable a separation of concerns between access control and the functionality of a
given application being protected.
Such an approach is only possible through a generic interface. At CEDA, this has been realised in the
Python programming language using the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) specification. A parallel Java
filter based implementation is also under development with our US partners for use with the THREDDS Data
Server. Using such technologies applications and middleware can be assembled into custom configurations to
meet different requirements. In the case of access control, NDG Security middleware can be layered over the top
of existing applications without the need to modify them. A RESTful approach to the application of authorisation
policy has been key in this approach. We explore the practical implementation of such a scheme alongside the
application of the ESG security architecture to CEDA's OGC web services implementation COWS.},

Alongside these present climate simulations a parallel ensemble looking at extremes of future climate was run, using a time-slice methodology to consider conditions at the end of this century.
 These simulations were primarily performed using a 144 million core hour, single year grant of computing time from PRACE (the Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe) in 2012, with additional resources supplied by the Natural Environment  Research Council (NERC) and the Met Office.  Almost 400 terabytes of simulation data were generated on the HERMIT supercomputer at the High Performance Computing Center Stuttgart (HLRS), and transferred to the JASMIN super-data cluster provided by the Science and Technology Facilities Council Centre for Data Archival (STFC CEDA) for analysis and storage.
 In this paper we describe the implementation of the project, present the technical challenges in terms of optimisation, data output, transfer and storage that such a project involves and include details of the model configuration and the composition of the UPSCALE data set.  This data set is available for scientific analysis to allow assessment of the value of model resolution in both present and potential future climate conditions.},

Information is transferred from observations to unobserved variables in two ways: through the temporal evolution of the predictive equations (either a forecast model or its adjoint) or through an error covariance matrix (or a parametrized approximation to the error covariance). Here, it is found that high frequency information tends to flow through the former route, low frequency through the latter. It is also noted that using the Kalman Filter analysis to estimate the correlation between the observed and unobserved variables can lead to a biased result because of an error correlation: this error correlation is absent when the Kalman Smoother is used.},

  abstract = {A series of experiments are described that examine the sensitivity of the northern-hemisphere winter evolution to the equatorial quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The prime tool for the experiments is a stratosphere-mesosphere model. The model is integrated over many years with the modelled equatorial winds relaxed towards observed values in order to simulate a realistic QBO. In experiment A the equatorial winds are relaxed towards Singapore radiosonde observations in the height region 16-32 km. In contrast to previous modelling studies, the Holton-Tan relationship (warm/cold winters associated with easterly/westerly QBO winds in the lower stratosphere) is absent. However, in a second experiment (run B) in which the equatorial winds are relaxed towards rocketsonde data over the extended height range 16-58 km, a realistic Holton-Tan relationship is reproduced. A series of further studies are described that explore in more detail the sensitivity to various equatorial height regions and to the bottom-boundary forcing. The experiments suggest that the evolution of the northern-hemisphere winter circulation is sensitive to equatorial winds throughout the whole depth of the stratosphere and not just to the lower-stratospheric wind direction as previously assumed.},

  doi = {doi:10.5194/acp-11-3913-2011},
  abstract = {The Along-Track Scanning Radiometers (ATSRs) provide a long time-series of measurements suitable for the retrieval of cloud properties. This work evaluates the freely-available Global Retrieval of ATSR Cloud Parameters and Evaluation (GRAPE) dataset (version 3) created from the ATSR-2 (1995\textendash{}2003) and Advanced ATSR (AATSR; 2002 onwards) records. Users are recommended to consider only retrievals flagged as high-quality, where there is a good consistency between the measurements and the retrieved state (corresponding to about 60\% of converged retrievals over sea, and more than 80\% over land). Cloud properties are found to be generally free of any significant spurious trends relating to satellite zenith angle. Estimates of the random error on retrieved cloud properties are suggested to be generally appropriate for optically-thick clouds, and up to a factor of two too small for optically-thin cases. The correspondence between ATSR-2 and AATSR cloud properties is high, but a relative calibration difference between the sensors of order 5\textendash{}10\% at 660 nm and 870 nm limits the potential of the current version of the dataset for trend analysis. As ATSR-2 is thought to have the better absolute calibration, the discussion focusses on this portion of the record. Cloud-top heights from GRAPE compare well to ground-based data at four sites, particularly for shallow clouds. Clouds forming in boundary-layer inversions are typically around 1 km too high in GRAPE due to poorly-resolved inversions in the modelled temperature profiles used. Global cloud fields are compared to satellite products derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) measurements, and a climatology of liquid water content derived from satellite microwave radiometers. In all cases the main reasons for differences are linked to differing sensitivity to, and treatment of, multi-layer cloud systems. The correlation coefficient between GRAPE and the two MODIS products considered is generally high (greater than 0.7 for most cloud properties), except for liquid and ice cloud effective radius, which also show biases between the datasets. For liquid clouds, part of the difference is linked to choice of wavelengths used in the retrieval. Total cloud cover is slightly lower in GRAPE (0.64) than the CALIOP dataset (0.66). GRAPE underestimates liquid cloud water path relative to microwave radiometers by up to 100 g m-2 near the Equator and overestimates by around 50 g m-2 in the storm tracks. Finally, potential future improvements to the algorithm are outlined.},

This paper presents the validation of aerosol optical depths (AODs) over the ocean from this product against AERONET sun-photometer measurements, as well as a comparison to the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) optical depth product produced by the Global Aerosol Climatology Project (GACP). 

The GRAPE AOD over ocean is found to be in good agreement with AERONET measurements, with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.79 and a best-fit slope of 1.0$\pm$0.1, but with a positive bias of 0.08$\pm$0.04. Although the GRAPE and GACP datasets show reasonable agreement, there are significant differences. These discrepancies are explored, and suggest that the downward trend in AOD reported by GACP may arise from changes in sampling due to the orbital drift of the AVHRR instruments.},

For the Climate Model Inter-comparison Project 5 (CMIP5), a distributed archive is being constructed to provide access to what is expected to be in excess of 10 Peta-bytes of global climate change projections. The data will be held at computing centres and data archives around the world, but for users it will appear as a single archive described by one catalogue.

  abstract = {The results of climate models are of increasing and widespread importance. No longer is climate model output of sole interest to climate scientists and researchers in the climate change impacts and adaptation fields. Now nonspecialists such as government officials, policy makers, and the general public all have an increasing need to access climate model output and understand its implications. For this host of users, accurate and complete metadata (i.e., information about how and why the data were produced) is required to document the climate modeling results. Here we describe a pilot community initiative to collect and make available documentation of climate models and their simulations. In an initial application, a metadata repository is being established to provide information of this kind for a major internationally coordinated modeling activity known as CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5). It is expected that for a wide range of stakeholders, this and similar community-managed metadata repositories will spur development of analysis tools that facilitate discovery and exploitation of Earth system simulations.},

Physical colocation of the core JASMIN resource with significant components of the facility for Climate and Environmental Monitoring from Space (CEMS) provides additional support for the earth observation community, as well as facilitating further comparison and evaluation of models with data. JASMIN and CEMS together centrally deploy 9.3 PB of storage - 4.6 PB of Panasas fast disk storage alongside the STFC Atlas Tape Store. Over 370 computing cores provide local computation. Remote JASMIN resources at Bristol, Leeds and Reading provide additional distributed storage and compute configured to support local workflow as a stepping stone to using the central JASMIN system. Fast network links from JASMIN provide reliable communication between the UK supercomputers MONSooN (at the Met Office) and HECToR (at the University of Edinburgh). JASMIN also supports European users via a light path to KNMI in the Netherlands. The functional components of the JASMIN infrastructure have been designed to support and integrate workflows for three main goals: (1) the efficient operation of data curation and facilitation at the STFC Centre for Environmental Data Archival; (2) efficient data analysis by the UK and European climate and earth system science communities, and; (3) flexible access for the climate impacts and earth observation communities to complex data and concomitant services.},

  abstract = {A climate model represents a multitude of processes on a variety of timescales and space scales: a canonical example of multi-physics multi-scale modeling. The underlying climate system is physically characterized by sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and natural stochastic variability, so very long integrations are needed to extract signals of climate change. Algorithms generally possess weak scaling and can be I/O and/or memory-bound. Such weak-scaling, I/O, and memory-bound multi-physics codes present particular challenges to computational performance.  Traditional metrics of computational efficiency such as performance counters and scaling curves do not tell us enough about real sustained performance from climate models on different machines. They also do not provide a satisfactory basis for comparative information across models. codes present particular challenges to computational performance.  We introduce a set of metrics that can be used for the study of computational performance of climate (and Earth system) models. These measures do not require specialized software or specific hardware counters, and should be accessible to anyone. They are independent of platform and underlying parallel programming models. We show how these metrics can be used to measure actually attained performance of Earth system models on different machines, and identify the most fruitful areas of research and development for performance engineering. codes present particular challenges to computational performance.  We present results for these measures for a diverse suite of models from several modeling centers, and propose to use these measures as a basis for a CPMIP, a computational performance model intercomparison project (MIP).},
