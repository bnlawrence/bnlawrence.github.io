I've been invited back to [Oxford AOPP](http://www-atm.physics.ox.ac.uk) to give a seminar in March. The seminar coordinator tells me it'll be over ten years since I last gave a seminar there. Last time it was on gravity waves (no, not gravitational waves!).
This time it wont be directly about atmospheric science research, but about very relevant technologies:

####  Communicating scientific thoughts and data: from weblogs to the NERC 
DataGrid via data citation and institutional repositories  

For centuries the primary method of scientific communication has revolved 
around papers submitted either as oral contributions to a meeting or as 
written contributions to journals. Peer reviewed papers have been the gold 
standard of scientific quality, and the preservation of scientific knowledge 
has relied on preserving paper. ?The establishment (whatever that is) has 
assessed productivity and impact by counting numbers of papers produced and 
cited. Yet clearly much of the bedrock of scientific productivity depends on 1.  Faster and more effective communication methods (witness the growth of 
preprint repositories and weblogs) and1.  Vast amounts of data, of which more and more is digital.

Digital data to leads opportunities to ?introduce data publication (and 
citation) and to exploit metanalyses of data aggregations. Electronic 
journals and multimedia lead to a blurring of the distinction between 
"literary" outputs (i.e papers) and "digital" outputs (i.e. data). ?Web 
publication alone leads to a blurring of the understanding of what 
publication itself means. Digital information is potentially far harder to 
preserve for posterity than paper.

This seminar will review some of these issues, and introduce two major 
projects led by the NCAS British Atmospheric Data Centre, and embedded in 
earth system science, aimed at developing technologies (and cultures) that 
will change how we view and do publication and data exploitation.
