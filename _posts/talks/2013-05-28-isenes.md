The Future of ESGF in the context of ENES and IS-ENES2
------------------------------------------------------

Presentation: [pdf]({{"assets/talks/2013-05-28-lawrence-isenes2-kickoff.pdf" | absolute_url}}) (2MB).

I probably tried to do too much in this talk. There were three subtexts:
1. We as a community have too much data to handle, and I mentioned the apocryphal estimate that only 2/3 of data written is read ... but I confused folks ... that figure applies to institutional data, not data in ESGF ...
1. That the migration of data and information between domains (see the talk) requires a lot of effort, and that (nearly) no one recognises or funds that effort (kudos to KNMI :-),
1. That portals are easy to build, but hard to build right, and maybe we need fewer, or maybe we need more, but either way, they need to *both* meet requirements in technical functionality, and information (as opposed to data) content.
