ExCALIBUR for ESCAPE
--------------------

Presentation: [pdf](/assets/talks/2021-09-03-ExCALIBUR-for-ESCAPE.pdf) (1.7MB)

The Exascale Computing ALgorithms & Infrastructures for the Benefit of UK Research ([ExCALIBUR](https://excalibur.ac.uk)) programme is a five year activity with two delivery partners: the [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk)(for PSREs amd the [NERC](https://ukri.org/councils/nerc) community) and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([EPSRC](httpsL//ukri.org/councils/epsrc)). The aim of the project is to redesign high priority simulation codes and algorithms to fully harness the power of future supercomputers, keeping UK research and development at the forefront of high-performance simulation science.

This talk (part of the [ESCAPE-2 Final Dissemination Workshop](https://www.hpc-escape2.eu/outreach/events/escape-2-final-dissemination-workshop)) outlines key aspects of the programme, including a summary of the priority use cases with a bit more detail about the environmental science projects (which are all related to the next generation modelling system which will replace the current Unified Model). Some cross-cutting areas are listed and there is a summary of our ExCALIData project (see [my last talk]({{ site.url }}{% link _posts/talks/2021-09-02-esi-to-exc.md %})).
