Weather and Climate Computing Futures in the context of European Competitiveness
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Presentation: [pdf](/assets/talks/2012-09-19-Lawrence_ICTBigData.pdf) (4 MB).

In this talk I addressed some elements of how climate science interacts with policy and societal competitiveness in the contentxt of extreme climate events etc, but the main body was on the consequences for modelling and underlying infrastructure.

This table drives much of the conversation:

| Key numbers for Climate Earth System Modelling                                      |         2012 |          2016 |             2020 |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------:|--------------:|-----------------:|
| Horizontal resolution of each coupled model component (km)                          |          125 |            50 |               10 |
| Increase in horizontal parallelisation wrt 2012 <br/>(hyp: weak scaling in 2 directions) |            1 |          6.25 |           156.25 |
| Horizontal parallelization of each coupled model component<br/>(number of cores)        |     1,00E+03 |      6,25E+03 |         1,56E+05 |
| Vertical resolution of each coupled model component<br/>(number of levels)              |           30 |            50 |              100 |
| Vertical parallelization of each coupled model component                            |            1 |             1 |               10 |
| Number of components in the coupled model                                           |            2 |             2 |                5 |
| Number of members in the ensemble simulation                                        |           10 |            20 |               50 |
| Number of models/groups in the ensemble experiments                                 |            4 |             4 |                4 |
| Total number of cores (4x6x7x8x9)<br/> (Increase:)                                       | 8,00E+04<br/>(1) | 1,00E+06<br/>(13) | 1,56E+09<br/>(19531) |
| Data produced (for one component in<br/> Gbytes/month-of-simulation)                     |          2,5 |            26 |             1302 |
| Data produced in total (in<br/> Gbytes/month-of-simulation)                              |          200 |          4167 |          1302083 |
| Increase                                                                            |            1 |            21 |             6510 |


The bottom line in the talk was that to deliver on all of this requires
European scale infrastructure, that is, computing AND networks targeted at
data analysis as well as data production!
