Opportunities and Challenges for Data Science in (Big) Environmental Science
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Presentation: [pdf](/assets/talks/2018-03-26_data_science.pdf) (18 MB) (See also [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqf79JDY83A)).

I was asked to give a talk on data science in climate science. After working out what "data science" might mean for this audience, I took a rather larger view of
what was needed and talked about data issues in environmental science, before quickly talking about hardware and software platform issues. Most of the talk covered a few applications of modern
data science: data assimilation, classification, homogenising data, and using machine learning to infer new products. I finished by reminding everyone that in collaborations between climate
science and statisticians and computer scientists, we need to be careful about our use of the
word "model" (with a bit of help from [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1838/)).  I finished with reminding everyone that climate science has always been a data science.
