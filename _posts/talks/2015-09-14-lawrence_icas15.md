 UK academic infrastructure to support (big) environmental science
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Presentation: [pdf]({{"assets/talks/2015-09-14-lawrence_icas15.pdf" | absolute_url}}) (18 MB).

Abstract:  Modern environmental science requires the fusion of ever growing volumes of data from multiple simulation and observational platforms. In the UK we are investing in the infrastructure necessary to provide the generation, management, and analysis of the relevant datasets. This talk discusses the existing and planned hardware and software infrastructure required to support the (primarily) UK academic community in this endeavour, and relates it to key international endeavours at the European and global scale â€“ including earth observation programmes such as the Copernicus Sentinel missions, the European Network for Earth Simulation, and the Earth System Grid Federation.
