Cyberinfrastructure Challenges (from a climate science repository perspective)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Presentation: [pdf](/assets/talks/2010-09-30-cyberinfrastructure_for_data) (2MB).

I gave a very short presentation at this NSF sponsored workshop.
See [my blog entry]({% post_url oldblog/2010-09-30-cyberinfrastructure_for_data %})
for a commentary.

**Update** (*Bryan, 31st January, 2017*): The output of this workshop eventually appeared in an [NSF Report](https://www.nsf.gov/cise/oac/taskforces/TaskForceReport_Data.pdf).
