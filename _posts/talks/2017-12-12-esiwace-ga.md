Exploiting Weather & Climate Data at Scale (WP4)
------------------------------------------------

Presentation: [pdf](/assets/talks/171212_esiwace_wp4.pdf) (4 MB)

This was a talk I would have given in partnership with Julian Kunkel, but as I was still at home thanks to a wee bit of cold air causing chaos at LHR, Julian had to give all of it. The version linked here is the version I would have given, the actual version Julian gave will (eventually) be available on the ESIWACE website.

The talk covers the "exploitability" component of the [ESIWACE](https://www.esiwace.eu) project. The work we describe is development of cost models for exascale HPC storage, plus new software to write and manage data at scale.
