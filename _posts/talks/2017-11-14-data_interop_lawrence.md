Data Interoperability and Integration: A climate modelling perspective
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Presentation: [pdf](/assets/talks/2017-11-14-171104_data_interop_lawrence.pdf) (11.5 MB).

I was asked to give a talk at a [CODATA](http://www.codata.org/) meeting which was aimed at developing a roadmap for:
1. Mobilising community support and advice for discipline-based initiatives to develop online data capacities and services;
1. Priorities for work on interdisciplinary data integration and flagship projects;
1. Approaches to funding and coordination; and
1. Issues of international data governance.

For this talk I was asked to address an example from the WMO research community on what we have accomplished in standardising a range of things, and reflecting on what has worked/failed and why.  I wasn't given much time to prepare, so this is what they got!
