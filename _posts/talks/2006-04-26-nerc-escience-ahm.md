NERC DataGrid Status
--------------------

Presentation: [pdf]({{"assets/talks/2006-04-26-nerc-escience-ahm.ppt" | absolute_url}}) (5 MB).

In this presentation, I present some of the motivation for the [NERC DataGrid](http://ndg.nerc.ac.uk) development (the key points being that we want semantic access to distributed data with no centralised user management), link it to the ISO TC211 standards work, and take the listener through a tour of some of the NDG products as they are now. There is a slightly more detailed look at the Climate Sciences Modelling Language, and I conclude with an overview of the NDG roadmap.
