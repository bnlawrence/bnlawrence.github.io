The Data Deluge in High Resolution Climate and Weather Simulation
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Presentation: [pdf]({{"assets/talks/171122_HPC_Bigdata_Joussaume_VF.pdf" | absolute_url}}) (5 MB).

This talk was given by Sylvie Joussaume, but we had worked on it together, so I think it's fair enough to include here. We wanted to show the scale of the data problems we have in climate science, and some of the direction in which we are moving with respect to "big data" technologies and algorithms.
