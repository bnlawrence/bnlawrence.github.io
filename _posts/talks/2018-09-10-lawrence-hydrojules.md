Building a Community Hydrological Model
---------------------------------------

Presentation: [pdf](/assets/talks/2018-09-10-lawrence-hydrojules.pdf) (9 MB)

In this talk we introduce how NCAS will be supporting the [Hydro-Jules Project](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/our-science/projects/hydro-jules) by designing and implmenting the modelling framework and building and maintaing and archive of driving data, model configurations, and supporting datasets. We will also be providing training and support for the community on the [JASMIN](https://www.jasmin.ac.uk) supercomputer.

We also discuss some of the issue that HydroJules will need to prepare for, including the impending change to the UK Unified Modelling modelling framework and exascale computing.
