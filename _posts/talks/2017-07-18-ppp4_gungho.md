Performance, Portability, Productivity: Which two do you want?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Presentation: [pdf]({{"assets/talks/2017-07-18-ppp4_gungho.pdf" | absolute_url}}) (4 MB).

I talked about two papers that I've recently been involved with: "CPMIP: measurement of real computational performance of Earth System Models in CMIP6" (which appeared in early 2017) and "Crossing the Chasm: How to develop weather
and climate models for next generation computers?" which at the time was just about to be submitted to GMD.
