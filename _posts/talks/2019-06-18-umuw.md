Challenges facing the modelling community
-----------------------------------------

Presentation: [pdf](/assets/talks/2019-06-17-lawrence-umuw19.pdf) (8 MB)

This was a talk given to set the scene for the Next Generation Modelling System sessions of the 2019 Unified Model (Um) 
Users workshop - a meeting of the international UM partnership bringing together indivudals from the US, Korea, Australia, 
NZ, and the UK. 

It was a shortened version of my [seminar](/talks/2019/03/end-of-climate-modelling/) on the end of climate modelling, where
I was aiming to explain to some of the attendees why the radical changes in model structure coming with our next 
generation LFRic model are necessary given some of the technologies in play. I was able to omit some of the key parts of
the seminar because there were other speakers addressing those subjects (e.g. Rupert Ford was up later talking about
Domain Specific Languages).
