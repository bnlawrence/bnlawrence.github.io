There were two back to back meetings organised as part of the 2015 Big Data and Extreme Computing meeting [website](http://www.exascale.org/bdec/agenda/barcelona).  In the first, organised as part of the European Exascale Software Initiative (EESI), I gave a full talk, in the second, I provided a four page position paper with a four page exposition.
