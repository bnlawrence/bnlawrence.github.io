EuroHPC: Requirements from Weather and Climate
----------------------------------------------

Presentation: [pdf](/assets/talks/2018-06-13-EuroHPC_Esiwace_v3.pdf) (9 MB)

Abstract: [pdf](/assets/abstracts/2018-06-13-EuroHPC_ESIWACE_OnePageRequirements.pdf)

This talk covered requirements for the upcoming pre-exascale and
exascale computers to be procured by the EuroHPC project. The bottom line
is that Weather and Climate have strong constraints on HPC environnments, and
we believe that procurement benchmarks should measure science throughput
in science units (in our case Simulated Years Per (real) Day, SYPD).  We
also recommend that the EuroHPC project takes cognisance of the fact that HPC
simulations do not directly generate knowledge, the knowledge comes from
analysis of the data products!
