This was an inaugural meeting of the UK high resolution
climate modelling community under the auspices of the new
UK National Climate Science Partnership.

I was asked for ten minutes on data challenges at high resolution. What I chose to present here was
- a reminder of the scale of the challenge (with a very
old slide showing the number of numbers a 1km global run will produce),
- a list of challenges and issues to consider, 
- some pieces of Excalibur and Esiwace funded research we have been doing 
in this space (on aggregations an ensemble analysis, more about those
another day),
- some of the conclusions of the ENES infrastructure strategy[^1] which 
address workflow, and in particular how the advent of in-flight analysis
on top of large communities of downstream analysts requires us to start treating big experiments 
more like satellite missions than personal research projects.
