Data Centre Technology to Support Environmental Science
-------------------------------------------------------

Presentation: [pdf]({{"assets/talks/2016-10-13-lawrence_infrastructure.pdf" | absolute_url}}) (18 MB).

This was a talk given at a NERC Town Hall meeting on the future of data centres in London, on the 13th of October 2016.  My brief was to talk about underlying infrastructure, which I did here by discussing the relationship between scientific data workflows and the sort of things we do with JASMIN.
