Computer Science Issues in Environmental Infrastructure
-------------------------------------------------------

Presentation: [pdf]({{"assets/talks/2016-09-15-lawrence.pdf" | absolute_url}}) (14 MB).

This was a talk at a University of Reading symposium held with Tony Hey, Geoffrey Fox  and Jeff Dozier as guest speakers as part of the introduction o the new Computer Science Department in the Reading University School of Mathematical, Physical and Computer Sciences [SMPCS](http://www.reading.ac.uk/smpcs-home.aspx).

The main aim of my talk was to get across the wide range of interesting generic science and engineering challenges we face in delivering the infrastructure needed for environmental science.
