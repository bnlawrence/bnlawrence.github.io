Issues to address before we can have an open climate modelling ecosystem
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Abstract* Earth system and climate models are complex assemblages of code which are
an optimisation of what is known about the real world, and what we can afford
to simulate of that knowledge. Modellers are generally experts in one part of
the earth system, or in modelling itself, but very few are experts across the
piste.  As a consequence, developing and using models (and their output)
requires expert teams which in most cases are the holders of the "institutional
wisdom" about their model, what it does well,and what it doesn't.  Many of
us have an aspiration for an open modelling ecosystem, not only to provide
transparency and provenance for results, but also to expedite the modelling
itself. However an open modelling ecosystem will depend on opening access to
code, to inputs, to outputs, and most of all, on opening the access to that
institutional wisdom (in such a way that the holders of such wisdom are
protected from providing undue support for third parties). Here we present
some of the lessons learned from how the metafor and curator projects
(continuing forward as the es-doc consortium) have attempted to encode such wisdom as documentation. We will concentrate on both technical and social issues that we have uncovered, including a discussion of the place of peer review and
citation in this ecosystem.
