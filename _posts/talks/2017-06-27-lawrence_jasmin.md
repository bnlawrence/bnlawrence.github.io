I gave two versions of this talk, one at at the International Supercomputing Conference's Workshop on HPC I/O in the data centre, and one at the 2017 JASMIN User's Conference.

The talk covered the structure and usage of JASMIN, showing there is a lot of data movement both in the batch system and the interactive environment.  One key observation was that we cannot afford to carry on with parallel disk, and we don't think tape alone is a solution, so we are investigating object stores, and
object store interfaces.
