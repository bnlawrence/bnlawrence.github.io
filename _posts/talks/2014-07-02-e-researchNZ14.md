I gave three talks at this meeting:

Environmental Modelling at both large and small scales: How simulating complexity leads to a range of computing challenges
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Presentation: [pdf](/assets/talks/2014-06-30-lawrence_eresearchNZ14_hpc.pdf) (2 MB).

On Monday, in the HPC workshop, despite using the same title I had for the Auckland seminar, I primarily talked about the importance of software supporting collaboration, using coupling as the exemplar (reprising some of the material I presented in Boulder in early 2013).

The road to exascale for climate science: crossing borders or crossing disciplines, can one do both at the same time?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Presentation: [pdf](/assets/talks/2014-07-01-lawrence_eresearchNZ14_keynote.pdf) (9 MB)

On Tuesday I gave the keynote address:

*Abstract:* The grand challenges of climate science have significant infrastructural implications, which lead to requirements for integrated e-infrastructure - integrated at national and international scales, but serving users from a variety of disciplines. We begin by introducing the challenges, then discuss the implications for computing, data, networks, software, and people, beginning from existing activities, and looking out as far as we can see (spoiler alert: not far!)

JASMIN: the Joint Analysis System for big data
----------------------------------------------

On Wednesday I gave a short talk on JASMIN:

*Abstract:* JASMIN is designed to deliver a shared data infrastructure for the UK environmental science community.  We describe the hybrid batch/cloud environment and some of the compromises we have made to provide a curated archive inside and alongside various levels of managed and unmanaged cloud ... touching on the difference between backup and archive at scale. Some examples of JASMIN usage are provided, and the speed up on workflows we have achieved. JASMIN has just recently been upgraded, having originally been designed for atmospheric and earth observation science, but now being required to support a wider community. We discuss what was upgraded, and why.
