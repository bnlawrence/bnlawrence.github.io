I've just discovered that Internet Explorer has been rendering the menu for this site with nothing readable in the menu ... for three months! (I checked it out on firefox, konqueror, and safari ...). The menu used to look like this:
![Image: IMAGE: static/2005/01/25/iesuck_screenshot.jpg ](/assets/images/2005-01-25-iesuck_screenshot.jpg)

The culprit? My css used to have
    div#menu p {
      margin-top       : 0px;
      margin-bottom    : 0px;
      font             : 0.9em "trebuchet ms", verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;
      line-height      : 1.1em;
    }
Now I've removed the *0.9 em * it seems to work fine. Of course it looks ever so slightly less attractive on the other browsers. My, I hate IE!

**Note added later**: actually, it turns out that even this hasn't worked properly on IE explorer, I suspect those of you with IEV6 will be seeing the image in the bottom right and overlaying some of the text. I might not blame IE too harshly though - it's possible that the html soup on this page has confused it. Maybe my new wiki code will clean this up ... but we'll have to wait for that.
