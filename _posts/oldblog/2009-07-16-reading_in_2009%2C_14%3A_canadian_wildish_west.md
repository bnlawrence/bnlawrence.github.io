Anne picked up [The Tenderness of Wolves](http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=isbn%3A1847240674) by [Stef Penney](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stef_Penney) somewhere, but I snaffled it out of her  book queue while she wasn't looking.

I can see why this was a [prize winning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Book_Awards#2006) book. It is a good read, although I thought a few too many threads were left hanging at the end. In that sense it felt not quite finished, although to be fair, the hanging threads weren't dangling completely unsuspended. Read it for
yourself to make sense of this paragraph!

It is worth the read. The book is set in Canada in 1867, where in a small community
a man is found dead, scalped, in a cabin. Much follows, with several treks across
the wintry desolate Canadian north (probably by a few too many people, there's
one lot whose only function seems to be to link two disparate parts of the story).
There are some characters who are drawn in lots of detail, and then seem to
disappear without trace, and others are drawn in less detail, but more central
to the story. However, all this seems a bit carping. I liked the book, and
as a tale of epic derring do of (wo)man against nature, it does very well.

I'm amused that wikipedia says that Penny was suffering from agoraphobia
while writing the book, and the research was all done in the library. What
was that about plagiarism being copying from one person, and research (novelty
in this case) being copying from many people?
