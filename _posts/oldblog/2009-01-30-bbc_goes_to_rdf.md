[RDF goes big at the BBC](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Nodalities/~3/527180596/building-coherence-at-bbccouk.php)!

And not only that, they built their domain model first then built an RDF ontology:
<blockquote>We set about converting our programmes domain model into an RDF ontology which we've since published under a Creative Commons License (www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/programmes/). Which took one person about a week. The trick here isn't the RDF mapping - it's having a well thought through and well expressed domain model. And if you're serious about building web sites that's something you need anyway.
</blockquote>

Someone once said to me that RDF wasn't big out there. Well I knew it was, and maybe he will believe me now!

Another (related) key point in the BBC article is the importance of identifier (URI) management.
Linking is chaotic and unstable until you take that on seriously.
