I've just spent a frustrating hour trying to find rss feeds
for the table of contents of atmospheric and climate journals. I've
found plenty of websites, and even email notification pages, but all I want
is RSS. Given our discipline really stretches computational ability
at the top end, why can't I find such a service, when 
[even lawyers do it](http://law.wlu.edu/library/feeds/listfeeds.asp)?

Will I really have to do it myself? It looks like [ingenta](http://www.ingentaconnect.com) do actually produce rss feeds for some journals, but it's not obvious where the list of feeds can be found, and what journals are included. (It appears to be mainly Kluwer and Elsevier ...).

Meanwhile, I've started compiling a list of [atmospheric feeds](atmosfeeds) from the ingenta table. I'll add more as I find them (or write my own scrapers if I get desperate).
