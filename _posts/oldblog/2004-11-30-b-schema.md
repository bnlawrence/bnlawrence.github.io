The [NDG](/tags/ndg) b-schema is the heart of how we plan to support data **browsing** (as opposed to searching).

The key concept is that we have a simple relationship between observation stations (ObsStn), Data Production Tools (DPT), and Activities, which
are linked together by Deployments as depicted below:

Examples of how it could work would be 
* Instrumental: 
    * describe a bunch of tools with [SensorML](http://vast.uah.edu/SensorML/).
    * describe a bunch of places where it **could** be deployed with the ObsStn schema (we'll have to role our own)
    * describe the activities with free text
    * link them together in a deployment, which includes:
        * start date, end date
        * activityID, ObsStnID, DPT ID
        * any deploymen specific settings (e.g. calibration coefficients as actually used) ... we'd have to make sure that the DPT schema supported this because the attributes of the deployment should only be selectable from schemas defined at the higher level.

* Simulation
    * describe the model capabilities with the [EarleySuite](http://ugamp.nerc.ac.uk/bouton/model_metadata/index.php)
    * describe a bunch of computational environments with ObsStn (ok, we need to change the name of this thing)
    * describe the activities
    * link them together as above except the deployment specific settings would be from the schema of possible model settings implicit in the Earley Suite.
