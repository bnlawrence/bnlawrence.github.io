Spent nearly the entire week (and certainly more than a "European maximum 48-hours") on things to do with ESIWACE (on the deliverable  I mentioned last time, reporting for the EC, etc). I did have a fair chunk of one day on other things as also chaired a meeting of the advisory panel for our climate predictions for the copernicus climate data store project  (CP4CDS, a project about deploying and maintaining sofware for a special ESGF data node to support climate services) - that took up the best part of day. However, that's pretty much it for the week. Hard to believe we're two months into the year - and I still haven't come up for air and managed to create any significant blogging time.
