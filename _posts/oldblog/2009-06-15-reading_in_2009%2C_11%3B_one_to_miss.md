[The Genesis Secret](http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=isbn%3A9780007284146)
 by [Tom Knox](http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/k/tom-knox/)

The fundamental plot idea caught my attention in the airport bookshop. Time
was short, about to spend a week in Austria, quick I thought, buy it.  Given
a bit longer to browse, I might not ...

... and I would probably have been happier not having read this one. The
"genesis" part of the plot is reasonable, but the main narrative weaves
between the activities of a psychopathic killer who delights in horrific
methods of killing people and "our" hero, Rob. Obviously the threads
are brought together to an ultimately satisfactory conclusion, but
for my taste, there is far too much gruesome detail about the killings, and
the main tension in the book is about when next one will turn a page and
find something horrific described. The character descriptions are uneven, but
the plot does have enough momentum to drag you through the book, even as it
might sicken you. (I wonder what I might have done had I other reading
choices ...)

I did finish it, but I have no desire to read it again. I left it in my hotel
room. I've never done that before: bought a book, and not got it home, or
even thought it worthy of trading in.
