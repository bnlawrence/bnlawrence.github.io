Avoid it if you're travelling internationally.

Inbound, the immimgration folk are the slowest I've met in years of travelling into "fortress America".

Outbound, the security folk are the most officious and nasty of any airport I've ever been to (imagine travelling with a three year old, who having gone through
the scanner wearing a fleece is "offered" a choice of having to go back and take the fleece off or have a body search, even though the the scanner didn't ping).  That after ensuring that all the families with young children are in the longest queue possible.  Then, given the time one has to spend "airside" of security, the food and reading options there are terrible ...

If Newark is your only experience of flying in or out of the US, you may not want to come back. Fortunately it's not my only experience of the US.
