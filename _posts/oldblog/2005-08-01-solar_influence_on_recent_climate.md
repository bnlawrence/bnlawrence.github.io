There is a tiny war of words in Nature this week about reconstructions of solar influences on climate. [Muscheler et.al. (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature04045) claim that current solar activity is not particularly unusual in a criticism of [Solanki et.al. (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature02995) (who themselves claim that the last few decades are unusual with respect to the previous 11,000 years).  There is a [reply by Solanki et.al](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature04046) which essentially states that Muscheler et al have used an inappropriate normalisation to get large amounts of historical activity. It's only a tiny war though, because all parties agree with  [Solanki and Krivova (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2002JA009753) who demonstrate that even if the last few decades are unusual, they can't explain the recent warming.
