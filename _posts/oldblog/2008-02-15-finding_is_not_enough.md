It seems to be my day for wanting to quote folk:

On why finding something is not enough   ([via Bill de hOra](http://www.dehora.net/journal/2008/02/10/decentralizing-gensyms/)) Samuel Johnson (1753): <blockquote>I saw that one enquiry only gave occasion to another, that book
referred to book, that to search was not always to find, and to find
was not always to be informed.
</blockquote>

This is useful for me in the context of, yet again, having to describe [search behaviour]({% post_url oldblog/2005-01-07-searching_techniques %}) to yet another audience.
