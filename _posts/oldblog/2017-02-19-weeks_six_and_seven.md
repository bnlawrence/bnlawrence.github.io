Two weeks to report this time, primarily because I had a day off on sick leave, and two days on real leave, so there's only seven weekday workdays to talk about (although
I have just spent bit chunks of both yesterday and today, that is, sat and sun, on work as well).

Early on the main thing I was doing was trying to catch up on the ever
increasing email mountain, but  in week six, by the time I took out a day in
London for a NERC Information Strategy Group meeting (mostly about the future of
NERC data centres), a half day on technical futures for CEDA, another half day
on my final CEDA monthly meeting and a follow up meeting on CEDA support for
[SPARC](http://www.sparc-climate.org/), and a day off on sick leave, that only
left a few hours here and there to get much done. The net effect of course was
that the email mountain grew.

To be fair, it wasn't so much that the email mountain grew, but the Nozbe task
list grew. I did manage to process a lot of email, but quite a lot of things
got thrown onto the pile for "later".

Then this last week (week seven), we had a few days on holiday down Dorset/Devon way.
Just the couple of nights, but real recharge territory. However, back to work
on Wednesday, and back to London - this time for an NCAS Science Strategy
Board meeting, so only two real work days available.

So, in the work time, I did a wee bit of work on the ENES infrastructure foresight that I've talked about before, and quite a lot of work on the first deliverable we've
got for [ESIWACE](http://www.esiwace.eu): which is on requirements and business
modelling for (weather and climate) data centres.  Given the constraints on my
time during the week, it's been a big effort on that this weekend too.  I suspect
quite a few things from that will turn up on my blog ...

... but anyway, that's the weeks that were.
