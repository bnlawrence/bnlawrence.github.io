The easy way (with The GIMP): somehow select an area (choose by fuzzy selector contiguous colour is one good option), then, if your image hasn't got an alpha channel, add one (right click, choose transparency, add an alpha channel) ... then color to alpha (right click, choose transparency, color to alpha).
