Well, I haven't been to a major conference for a while, and I received a raft of invitations to give talks at [EGU](http://meetings.copernicus.org/egu2009/) this year.

So, with colleagues, we have a raft of abstracts submitted:1. [Metrics for Success in the Preservation of Scientific Data at the Centre for Environmental Data Archival (CEDA)](/assets/abstracts/2009-01-08-metrics.pdf)1. [A RESTful way to Manage Ontologies](/assets/abstracts/2009-01-09-onto.pdf)1. [Metadata Objects for Linking the Environmental Sciences (MOLES)](/assets/abstracts/2009-01-12-moles.pdf)1. [Models, Metadata and Metafor](/assets/abstracts/2009-01-12-metafor.pdf)1. [The European contribution to a global solution for access to climate model simulations](/assets/abstracts/2009-01-12-esnes.pdf)
