There are loads of depictions of the scientific method out there ...

This is one I've just prepared for a presentation next week. I thought it was worth sharing as is ... the key difference is in this one I wanted to highlight the role of existing data in the process, and the *necessity* of archiving and annotating product data. In anticipation of obvious objections: of course we don't archive *everything*, but the point here is that we *need* to consider archival and annotation as a formal part of the method.
