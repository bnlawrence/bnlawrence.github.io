[Patrick Logan](http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2005/02/tdd-test-driven-demo.html) has some really good thoughts on how to do design
a demo so that it doesn't break ... 

I liked his comparison with extreme programming. I liked this so much, I'm repeating it [here](GoodThoughts), because I figure I'm going to want to find this in ten years time, and who knows how long blogspot.com will last? (But please read his copy not mine).
