A colleague has sent me a copy of *The State of Fear* by Michael Crichton for my comment. I should hasten to add this colleague is not one of
my atmospheric science colleagues, who I suspect would all agree with
Myles Allen's [review](https://doi.org/doi:10.1038/433198a) in Nature.

I'll report my thoughts here .. eventually ... but it arrived just after a
fat parcel of rather lighter reading from Amazon ...
