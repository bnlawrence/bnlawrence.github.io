NASA have released a news [article](http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/ice_berg_ram.html) showing images from space of a large iceberg (about the size of Long Island, NY) moving towards the Drygalski Ice Tongue. The article speculates the collision is due within a few days, but even if it doesn't happen, the mpg movie that shows the comparative sizes of Long Island and the iceberg and then the movement of the iceberg is well worth a look.
