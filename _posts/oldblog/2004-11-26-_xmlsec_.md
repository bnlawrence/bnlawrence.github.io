Yesterday and today I got to spend some substantial time on trains (a trip to
Liverpool actually) ... and spent the time learning about 
[pyxmlsec](http://pyxmlsec.labs.libre-entreprise.org/) (and by implication 
[xmlsec](http://www.aleksey.com/xmlsec/)).  I was most interested in the
application of digitally signing xml documents (and the subsequent
verification). We need to do this for [NDG](/tags/ndg) authorisation.

Because xmlsec implements the W3C
[xml-signature](http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/) standard, the whole thing is
trivial. I had expected that I would have to do work parsing the signature
element to find out what algorithm to use ... and I was worried about how 
to find the public key of the signer.

As I say, it all turned out to be relatively trivial, especially in python. In
pseudo xml, we go from something like:
    &lt;Document&gt;
     &lt;children&gt; ... &lt;/children&gt;
    &lt;/Document&gt;
to
    &lt;Document&gt;
     &lt;children&gt; ... &lt;/children&gt;
     &lt;signature&gt; ... &lt;/signature&gt;
    &lt;/Document&gt;

But the beauty of it is that everything in the signature element is
standardised, and one can even load the X509 public certificate of the 
signer into the signature. Having done that, the public key is travelling with
the document. Of course to reliably verify one needs the public key of the signer of that person's (server?'s) certificate, but often that's going to be the root certificate, so we're likely to have that in a repository anyway.

So, it all become transparent and trivial in python ... I'm in the process of
building a light weight sign and verify class that uses pyxmlsec, and then we
wont have to worry about this any more ...
