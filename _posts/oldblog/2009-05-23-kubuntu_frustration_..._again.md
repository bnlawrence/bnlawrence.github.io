Late last year,  I wanted to upgrade my kubuntu to 8.10 (intrepid)... but I couldn't because bluetooth was [broken](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/intrepid/+source/kdebase-workspace/+bug/280997) in the release.

Now I can't upgrade to 9.04 (jaunty) because wireless is [broken](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-release-notes/+bug/339313).

All this because I really wanted to have openoffice 3.0 ... and better support for usb wireless dongles (because the internal wireless in my laptop is getting dodgy).

Oh well, maybe I will be back to taking macs seriously again ...
