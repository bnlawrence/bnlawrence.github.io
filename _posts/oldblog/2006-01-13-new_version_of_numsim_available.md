A new version of the NumSim metadata schema, along with documentation is now available. NumSim has been designed as a package module to add to standard metadata discovery records to discriminate between data sets which have resulted from simulations.

NumSim is currently available and documented on an NDG wiki [here](http://ndg.nerc.ac.uk/kwiki/ndg/index.cgi?NumSim), but will move to a more permanent location when we get our new ndg website up and about. Development versions will probably move onto this website though ... but not yet.
