I have just got a hard copy of the JISC briefing paper
on the [Data Deluge: Preparing for the explosion in Data](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/index.cfm?name=pub_datadeluge).

There are some good thoughts in here, and some key questions:<blockquote>... e-research data are likely to be annotated automatically and
stored in a digital archive or library? What will the role
of libraries be in this context?
</blockquote>

Indeed. As we all become responsible for our own information environment, my take on this is that the *library* function will become an advisory function
because:
<blockquote>... Could some institutions act as repositories for scientific
or technical data on behalf of a number of institutions?
</blockquote>

Is likely to be more and more true ... the cost of having local
copies of all relevant materials (be they physical or digital) will become prohibitive.
However, the cost of not having local expertise in how to find and
utilise digital (and physical) objects will  be too great for institutions.
The library function will remain, it'll just be different. Librarians
like to call themselves *Information Specialists*, and it's going
to be true!

By the way, I also liked these useful quantifications of thousand
fold increases:
<table border="1" rules="all"><tr><td align="center" colspan="1">&nbsp; 1 megabyte  &nbsp;</td><td align="center" colspan="1">&nbsp; A large novel &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" colspan="1">&nbsp; 1 gigabyte  &nbsp;</td><td align="center" colspan="1">&nbsp; Information in the human genome &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" colspan="1">&nbsp; 1 terabyte  &nbsp;</td><td align="center" colspan="1">&nbsp; Annual world literature production &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" colspan="1">&nbsp; 1 petabyte  &nbsp;</td><td align="center" colspan="1">&nbsp; All US Academic Research Libraries &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" colspan="1">&nbsp; 1 exabyte   &nbsp;</td><td align="center" colspan="1">&nbsp; 2/3 of annual production of information &nbsp;</td></tr>

</table><br/>
