We're pleased that our paper on the first year of JASMIN has been accepted by the [IEEE BigData 2013 conference](http://www.ischool.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2013).

I'll put a copy of the paper online soon, but for now, here is the abstract:

####  Storing and manipulating environmental big data
with JASMIN

JASMIN is a super-data-cluster designed to provide
a high-performance high-volume data analysis environment for
the UK environmental science community. Thus far JASMIN
has been used primarily by the atmospheric science and earth
observation communities, both to support their direct scientific
workflow, and the curation of data products in the STFC
Centre for Environmental Data Archival (CEDA). Initial JASMIN
configuration and first experiences are reported here. Useful
improvements in scientific workflow are presented. It is clear
from the explosive growth in stored data and use that there was
a pent up demand for a suitable big-data analysis environment.
This demand is not yet satisfied, in part because JASMIN does
not yet have enough compute, the storage is fully allocated, and
not all software needs are met. Plans to address these constraints
are introduced.
