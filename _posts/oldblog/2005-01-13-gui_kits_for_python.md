[jkx@home](http://www.larsen-b.com) has a brief review of his experience
with python gui toolkits. I've been flirting briefly with all of these
except glade based kits, so it's interesting he recommended it. 

My experience thus far had been pyqt was the best, and I too had been worried about the license ... and never managed to get wxpython to do much good for me (too many of the demos simply didn't function correctly on my suse distributions). Tkinter on the other hand was very good, but limited in some key ways (primarily to do with drag-n-drop).

One day I'll investigate the pyGTK [tutorial](http://primates.ximian.com/~sandino/python-glade/) he describes.
