I've just spent three weeks without my laptop. That's a story in itself. (IBM worldwide warranty for Lenovo might well work, but glacially, and  their ability to communicate sucks beyond belief ... but I'll tell that story another day, if I can be bothered).

So, while I was hamstrung, I was working on borrowed computers and laptops, and began to make a bit of use of [delicious.com](http://delicious.com) via the firefox plugin. Anyway, I'm back on my laptop, so I wanted konqueror to work with delicious. It's much easier than you think, but no prizes to delicious for telling you that you can pretty nearly copy the Safari instructions, i.e., all you need to do is drag the [relevant links](http://delicious.com/help/bookmarklets) into the right places:1. First, open up the "tools/Minitools/edit Minitools" window, and create a new bookmarklet called, say "post to delicious". Then drag the "Bookmarks on Delicious" javascript from the Safari section into the Location box.
    * You'll need to enable the extra toolbar if you haven't already, and click on the yellow star and unclick on your new menu item.1. Then just drag the "My Delicious" link onto your bookmark toolbar.

Job done.
