There's nothing like a big volcano to remind one of our precarious hold on planet earth. Thanks to [James](http://julesandjames.blogspot.com/2008/05/o-noes.html) for drawing my attention to [Chaiten](http://volcanism.wordpress.com/2008/05/07/image-of-the-chaiten-lava-dome/), and the fabulous pictures, via: [Alan Sullivan](http://www.seablogger.com/?p=10684),   [nuestroclima](http://www.nuestroclima.com/blog/?p=1003) and the [NASA earth observatory](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3).

Along with genetics[^1], volcanism was the other thing that could have kept me from physics ... neither quite made it :-).

Anyway, I'm not quite sure what sort of volcano it is, nor of the real import of the explosions thus far, but as a caldera type volcano it could be more impressive yet ... if it's even vaguely similar to [Taupo](http://www.geonet.org.nz/volcano/our-volcanoes/taupo.html). When I was a kid we grew up with stories of the 7m deep pyroclastic flow in Napier (a little over 100 km away). 

[^1]: you can read that phrase how you like :-)

Thanks for the link. That's a big caldera. I've heard of it. New Zealand, I believe.

Pre-eruption Chaiten was just a small crater in hilly country. There was no mountain, nor was there any great watery hole. The crater, not properly a caldera, was less than a mile across, and mostly filled with a lava dome that probably formed after the last eruption. 

In my first Chaiten post, I included a Landsat image of this very unimpressive feature. It formed about 9700 years ago. That may have been its first eruption. The fresh outbreak formed a new crater a short distance from the previous one. Yesterday's explosion merged the two craters into a much larger feature. Far worse may be coming.
