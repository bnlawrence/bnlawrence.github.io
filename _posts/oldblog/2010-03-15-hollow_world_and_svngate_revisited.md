For a number of projects I'm having to revisit some domain modelling, exploiting both [HollowWorld](https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/twiki/bin/view/AppSchemas/HollowWorld) and the upcoming ISO19156 Observations and Measurements standard.

Of course I'm still on a linux platform, so to do that end, I've updated my [cross over office](http://www.codeweavers.com/) installation to 9.0, and my [Enterprise Architect](http://www.sparxsystems.com/) to 7.5.

This note is by way of updating my [older posts]({% post_url oldblog/2008-05-24-ea_and_subversion_resolved %}) on using subversion in EA. Now, as then, one needs to follow the [svngate](http://www.codeweavers.com/support/wiki/EAsvn) instructions. I was surprised I still had to replace my 9.0 cmd.exe.so with a new one (ok actually an old one modified at cross over office version 6.2), but happy still to exploit svngate.  There appears to be no need now for any shenanigans with flipping argument order, svngate just works.

So, you can follow the [instructions](https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/twiki/bin/view/AppSchemas/ConfiguringUMLToolForHollowWorld) for hollow word installation exactly, once you've got svngate installed ...

... If you use Enterprise Architect with subversion on a linux 10.04 or later system, then this might help ...
