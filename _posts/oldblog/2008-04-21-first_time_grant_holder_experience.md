Buried in a Wall Street Journal [article](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120839518424921607.html?mod=opinion_main_commentaries)  ([thanks Michael](http://initforthegold.blogspot.com/2008/04/wsj-op-ed-laments-no-science-debate.html)) about the lack of involvement of the US presidential candidates in science issues is an interesting statistic:  <blockquote>At the National Institutes of Health, the average age of a first grant is 42 for a Ph.D. and 44 for an M.D.
</blockquote>

It'd be interesting to know about NSF too. 

Is it that much better here? I don't know! It would be interesting to see statistics for average ages of grant holders, and first time grant holders for NERC, EPSRC and STFC ...  

That said, it may well be illegal to hold that information here, and I'm not convinced NERC know how old I am, let alone anyone else. But it would still be interesting ...  although years since doctoral graduation is probably a better metric which might not be illegal to hold. The latter could only be obtained by survey.  Now if only I could convince someone to undertake such a survey ...
