For some reason both bloglines and technorati seem to have turned up their noses at my blog. I wouldn't mind, but I kind of rely on them to find if there are any inbound links to my blog (and thus anything worth pursuing). There aint much point asking the lazy web a question if I can't find any links pointing to the question ...

* Tecnorati is stuck claiming my latest post is from the 6th of October last year (despite the little preview graphic actually being current and a ping from yesterday).
* Bloglines has a post from November the 14th, but amusingly finds a citation to a january post when I look for posts, but doesn't find that post when I look for citations.
* Google blog reader finds my blog ok, and google web search finds stuff in my blog, but not google blog search. What to make of that?

Oh well. I guess I shouldn't be surprised, there's never been much overlap in what they found as citations, so the fact my posts themselves have disappared into obscurity snouldn't surprise me.

I've not played much with Bloglines, but as far as I can see, Technorati sucks! You can do successive searches and see stuff appearing or disappearing over a period of seconds.

Maybe you have to rely on lazyweb being interested enough to read, and post comments?

Hi Chris
I think you're right ... but sometimes I have found it useful to find inbound links where folk haven't commented here. Oh well, the upside is there is less to read this way :-)
Cheers
