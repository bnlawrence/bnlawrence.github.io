Here are two five day forecasts for Oxford issued by the Met Office - both were downloaded this afternoon. The first is via the BBC, the second from the Met Office site itself: ![Image: IMAGE: static/2005/12/07/BBC.Oxford.jpg ](/assets/images/2005-12-07-BBC.Oxford.jpg) ![Image: IMAGE: static/2005/12/07/MetO.Oxford.jpg ](/assets/images/2005-12-07-MetO.Oxford.jpg) Is it going to rain on Friday or not? Ostensibly these are forecasts issued around the same time (although one can't see obviously when the forecast was issued for the BBC one) ...  and as far as I know, both are issued automagically from the same input data. No wonder weather forecasts sometimes have a bad rep.
