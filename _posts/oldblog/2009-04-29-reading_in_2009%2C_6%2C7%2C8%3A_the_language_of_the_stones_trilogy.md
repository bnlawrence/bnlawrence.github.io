[The Language of the Stones](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/59204292),  [The Giant's Dance](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62264982), and [Whitemantle](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/225069516), by Robert Carter.

These three books are the literary equivalent of "quaffing wine", that is they're
inoffensive users of time which don't leave a memorable taste. I suppose one can't
drink (or read) the best stuff all of the time.

The basic 
idea of the books is quite a good one (how, and to some extent, why, the wars of the roses 
play out in a parallel earth where there is still magic). I should note
that while the books
all carry a prominent subtitle, "the third coming of Arthur", I think
that's a bit of a marketing ploy: the Arthurian
link in the concept is fairly weak, and doesn't really justify the 
subtitles. 

Given that I think the idea's a good
one, why is it "just" a quaffing sort of a book? Primarily because the books
meander along with many uninspiring passages of weak prose. Nonetheless,
I was interested enough to meander along with Will (the main character) all 
the way through the three books (I guess that must have been 1500 pages in all).
If you have the time, and any sort of "fantasy" bent, then you'll probably be
happy to read these books. If you're time pressed and/or fantasy isn't
one of your genres, then there are other books to read first ...

Having read the 1500 pages of this lot, I'm left thinking that if Readers Digest
got hold of these books, they could probably condense the three books down
into one good one: the concept, some of the events, and the characters could
have made a really cracking book if it had had some pace and tight prose. 

In a vague attempt at some even handedness in my 2009 book reviews, having read
this lot,  I'm minded to compare them with
my 
[criticism of 
The Pillars of the Earth]({% post_url oldblog/2009-03-13-reading_2009%2C_5%3A_pillars_need_shortening %}).  While I thought that book was too long, and
I claimed not be enthralled, compared to these three, Pillars is vastly
superior in pace and prose, so perhaps I was just a wee bit more enthralled reading
that than I thought at the end.

You may well care to try "The Deep" by John Crowley. It is (apparently) based no the wars of the roses, though I don't know the history well enough to tell. Maybe you now do. Its all short, and superb.

The trilogy is very very loosely based on the war of the roses, so there isn't any real history there, so I'm as ignorant as I was when I started. But, I'll read any book rated as short and superb: I will chase it up!
