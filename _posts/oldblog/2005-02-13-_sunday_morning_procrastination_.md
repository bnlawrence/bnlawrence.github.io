It's Sunday morning, and outside can't make up it's mind whether it is a hailstorm, a gale, rain, or sunshine ... clearly time to do something useful. So I'm procrastinating and catching up on blogs and such.

Patrick Logan's good value this morning. He also [pointed](http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2005/02/rubys-postulate.html)
me at Sam Ruby's [2004 presentation](http://intertwingly.net/slides/2004/devcon/) on encodings and difficulties with URIs. Patrick's quote from Sam that grabbed my attention was:<blockquote>The accuracy of metadata is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the data and the metadata.
</blockquote>

but the entire presentation is food for thought if you care about standardisation on the web in terms of encoding and why it matters. (Of course, initially I just liked the quote for it's wider connotations).

He (Sam Ruby) concludes with<blockquote>Comparing characters and uris is surprisingly more difficult and important than you might otherwise imagine (think: security holes).
</blockquote>

Having found this source of presentations, I also liked the
[2003 presentation](http://intertwingly.net/slides/2003/xmlconf) on some elements and details of atom, and in particular, this [statement](http://intertwingly.net/slides/2003/xmlconf/49.html) on required
versus optional elements:<blockquote>The number of optional features in XML is to be kept to the absolute minimum, ideally zero.  As a result of this, any XML document has a high probability of being handled successfully by any XML processor.
</blockquote>

... good advice for us in some of our NDG schema, many of which are very complicated, but they don't all need to be!
