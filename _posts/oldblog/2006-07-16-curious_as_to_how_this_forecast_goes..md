The met office via the BBC is forecasting another hot week:

it'll be interesting to [see how this one goes]({% post_url oldblog/2006-07-05-what_does_a_forecast_icon_mean%3F %}) ...

**Update (Tuesday night)**: A pretty good forecast thus far, at least as far as the maxima go. It hit at least  31 yesterday, and at least 32 today. I'm not so sure that the minimum temperature forecast is that good though!Anyway, this is the next five days forecast:

One day I might dig out some real data and look into whether or not this really is an uncommonly hot summer ...
