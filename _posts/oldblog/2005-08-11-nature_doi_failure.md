I don't know what it is with [Nature](http://www.nature.com), but yet [ again](http://home.badc.rl.ac.uk/lawrence/blog/2005/07/05/aerosol_climate_forcing#fn1), when I use their [RSS feed](http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss) to browse the table of contents of the [current issue](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v436/n7052/index.html), not one of the doi links to the complete story resolves!

It's not very professional for a journal with such a great reputation.
