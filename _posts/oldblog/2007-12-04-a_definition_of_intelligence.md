This quote is apparently from Piaget, but I got it from [Calvin](http://WilliamCalvin.com/1990s/1999intelligence-chapter.htm) [via a comment](http://www.inkstain.net/fleck/?p=2331#comment-214144) on Jeff Fleck's [blog](http://www.inkstain.net/fleck/?p=2331):<blockquote>intelligence is what you use when you don't know what to do, when neither innateness nor learning has prepared you for the particular situation.
</blockquote>

Memorable!

The context was pretty interesting too:  William H. Calvin, *[Pumping Up Intelligence: Abrupt Climate Jumps and the Evolution of Higher Intellectual Functions during the Ice Ages](http://WilliamCalvin.com/1990s/1999intelligence-chapter.htm.)*, in The Evolution of Intelligence, edited by R. J. Sternberg (Erlbaum, 2001), pp. 97-115
