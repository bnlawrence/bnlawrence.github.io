NDG is currently being developed around [eXist](http://exist.sourceforge.net), but we've had problems with scalability and reliability. It's not yet obvious why ... but as a consequence we've had to have some backup plans for what
would happen if eXist failed to deliver for us. One of our backup plans
was to keep an eye on the Berkely [DB XML](http://www.sleepycat.com/products/xml.shtml) project. We didn't use it initially because we wanted to exploit
xquery. Well, now, with version 2.07 announced (see previous link), it supports xquery, so no doubt we'll be testing it in the coming months.
It's very pleasing that there are already [suse rpms](http://pi3.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/~schiele/suse/).
