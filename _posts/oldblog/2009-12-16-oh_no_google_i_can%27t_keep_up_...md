As you have all noticed, I'm a tad busy at the moment, and blogging has been the obvious thing missing out. The other thing missing out is new technology:
* [Google Wave](http://wave.google.com) I hear you say?  No ...
* [Google Fusion Tables API](http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2009/12/google-fusion-tables-api.html)... oh no not another thing I can't pay attention to.

However, in finding out that I have to ignore another thing, I did follow the link to the [NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/science/15books.html?hpw) in [Joe's post](http://bitworking.org/news/2009/12/exaflood), to find a quote from Tony Hey that is SO RIGHT ON:
<blockquote> Tony Hey, a veteran British computer scientist now at Microsoft, said ... "In the U.K I saw many generations of graduates students really sacrificed to doing the low-level IT."
</blockquote>

Except it wasn't, and isn't, just the UK!

So timely. I gave a talk today about the pressure of big data, from models and earth observation ... and having to take it all seriously from a national infrastructure point of view ... I'll eventually stick the talk up on my publications page (it's too big to upload from home), but the slides alone won't tell the story ...

Actually there is a lot of other timely stuff going on. I'd like to be talking about the live blogging from AGU ... but I have time to skim the content, but not take it and comment here ...
