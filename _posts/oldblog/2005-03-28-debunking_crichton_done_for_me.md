I haven't finished with my comments on Crichton's book. I have finished reading it, and it sits on my desk with a few bits of paper marking things I want to pick up on ... but other things intrude :-)

Meanwhile, I can recommend [this](http://mustelid.blogspot.com/2005/03/myths-of-near-future.html) by William Connelly, which is a splendid summary of myths about climate change ... as I say, this more or less does my job for me. Some of the comments are pretty apposite too ...
