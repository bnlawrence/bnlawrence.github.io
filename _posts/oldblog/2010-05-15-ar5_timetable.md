I keep having to resort to web pages all over the place as well as email to find the AR5 timetable, which has changed a few times.  So I'm going to put it here, and update it as necessary (via trackbacks and/or direct editing).

**Updated 18/05/2010:** following Karl Taylor's comment below.

Hi Bryan,

As far as I know, this is consistent with recent further discussions except:

There are question marks that should be replaced with dashes (and in the first instance it should be December 2011 - February 2012.

I would promote the sub-bullet under Apr 2012 to a bullet, and use the following new, clearer wording (agreed to by Jerry Meehl and Thomas Stocker):  "Jul 2012: Papers must be submitted by 31 July 2012 to be eligible for assessment."

I would promote the sub-bullet under Jan 2013 to a bullet and use the following new, simpler wording: "Mar 2013: Papers cited by WG1 must be published or accepted by 15 March 2013 (with proof, for example, by a letter of confirmation from the editor)."
