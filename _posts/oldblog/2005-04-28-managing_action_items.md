[43 folders](http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/does_this_8220n.html) ([via dirtsimple](http://dirtsimple.org/2005/04/43-folders-does-this-next-action.htm)) has a nice discussion of how to manage one's action items, particularly in the context of categorising things into "next actions". I liked the following key points about action item lists (paraphrased):
* Actions need to be atomic (if not, put them on a project to-do list)
* Make them physical actions (not "think about", but "write notes" etc)
* Make sure that any dependencies are resolved
* If it's not something one is committed to (i.e. learn about something), then put on a different sort of list (e.g. on-hold, learning list, etc).
* Make them well defined (begin with a physical verb, e.g. email, call, recode, visit etc).
* Make sure the items are complete enough that you know what needs doing and why tomorrow, or next week, when you actually get to doing it.
