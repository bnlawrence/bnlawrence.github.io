When I was a lad, I thought nothing of reading a book a day. Now a book takes literally weeks to read, that's a combination of a lack of time to read (when I was a lad, hours of reading per day was fine, now it's minutes), and I suspect I read slower as well now too. Maybe I take more in now (though I'm not convinced, I can still read a book many times over and enjoy it nearly as much each time).

This lack of time for reading is not unrelated to a lack of time for blogging! So the relative quiet on this blog is a combination of both a lack of free time out of work, and too many balls in the air at work. For all of those waiting for metamodels part two, I have a [talk](http://home.badc.rl.ac.uk/lawrence/static/2008/09/09/metamodel.ppt) which should be grist for one or more posts, but I haven't had time to get there ...
