Everyone needs to understand this:
<blockquote>A 50%-good solution that people actually have solves more problems and survives longer than a 99% solution that nobody has because it's in your lab where you're endlessly polishing the damn thing. Shipping is a feature. A really important feature. Your product must have it.
</blockquote>

It applies to science too ... politics, you name it ...
