We've made some more progress with our thinking since [last week]({% post_url oldblog/2008-03-20-early_moles_version_two_thinking %}) ... but there is more to come.

Meanwhile:

Note the new relatedTo association class. That's in there to allow us to have arbitrary RDF associations between MOLES entities explicitly modelled. No idea if this is the right way to do it ... 

Note also that the services are placed more sensibly, and the concept supports both services intended for human consumption (that are "of the web") and which are 
for data consumption ...


#### trackbacks (1)

*[moles basic concepts]({% post_url oldblog/2008-06-04-moles_basic_concepts %}) (from "Bryan's Blog" on (on Wednesday 04 June, 2008)*)

Another interim version of MOLES ...
