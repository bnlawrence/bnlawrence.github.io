Maybe I should now have a category on programming language humour. Meanwhile, Chris responded to [this]({% post_url oldblog/2009-05-27-i_had_to_laugh %}) by digging out an email from 1994 on *how
to shoot yourself in the foot* using a multitude of languages. I googled it, and
found a [more extensive compendium](http://www.fullduplex.org/humor/2006/10/how-to-shoot-yourself-in-the-foot-in-any-programming-language/) (especially within the 301 comments) ...

So, for a taste of what lurks at that [link](http://www.fullduplex.org/humor/2006/10/how-to-shoot-yourself-in-the-foot-in-any-programming-language/) (and a multitude of other places on the net), we start with:

C
* You shoot yourself in the foot.

C++
* You accidentally create a dozen clones of yourself and shoot them all in the foot. Providing emergency medical assistance is impossible since you can't tell which are bitwise copies and which are just pointing at others and saying, "That's me, over there."

JAVA
* After importing java.awt.right.foot.* and java.awt.gun.right.hand.*, and writing the classes and methods of those classes needed, you've forgotten what the hell you're doing.
