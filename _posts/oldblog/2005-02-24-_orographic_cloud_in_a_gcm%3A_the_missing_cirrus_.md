At last a chance to talk about real science: Sam Dean, myself, Don Grainger, and Darlene Heuff (Dean et. al.) have had a paper on orographic cirrus accepted by Climate Dynamics. The abstract is:
<blockquote>Observations from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) are used to demonstrate that the 19-level HadAM3 version of the UK Met Office Unified Model does not simulate sufficient high cloud over land. By using low-altitude winds from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) Re-Analysis from 1979-1994 (ERA-15) to predict the
areas of maximum likelihood of orographic wave generation, it is shown that much of the deficiency is likely to be due to the lack of
a representation of the orographic cirrus generated by sub-grid scale orography. It is probable that this is a problem in most GCMs.
</blockquote>

Update (May 3rd, 2005): The complete reference is [doi:10.1007/s00382-005-0020-9](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-005-0020-9). A link to a personal copy of a pdf will eventually appear somewhere on this website.
