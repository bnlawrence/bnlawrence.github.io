The great British summer gets a pretty bad press from folks who come from my part of the world, but in my experience it's pretty unjustified. I think British weather gets its crap reputation (deservedly) from the other seasons, when it's not to unusual to go weeks without seeing even a glimpse of the sun. Having said that, occasionally, summer does go awol here in some years, but those years are getting fewer and further between ...

Meanwhile, what's to complain about in this met office (via bbc) forecast?:

Having just had a fantastic week of good weather in Edinburgh, I'm not complaining either!
