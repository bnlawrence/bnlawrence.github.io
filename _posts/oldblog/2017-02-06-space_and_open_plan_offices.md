I was paying a bit more attention to twitter this morning than usual (I'm hoping I'll  get some feedback on my analysis of citations that I posted yesterday). One thing that blew by was this headline [the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/12/30/google-got-it-wrong-the-open-office-trend-is-destroying-the-workplace/?tid=ss_tw&amp;utm_term=.e08d2e093c59):<blockquote>"Google got it wrong. The open-office trend is destroying the workplace."
</blockquote>

which took me back to [something that I wrote in 2005]({% post_url oldblog/2005-03-15-peopleware %}), reporting on work done long before.

It seems that Google was ignoring history as well. Unlike them.

There's been lots more work done since the work I cited in that blog post, [for example](https://www.dezeen.com/2016/09/15/open-plan-offices-co-working-less-productive-more-unfriendly-survey-auckland-university-technology/):<blockquote>Workers in open-plan offices are more distracted, unfriendly and uncollaborative than those in traditional workplaces, according to the latest industry survey.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Employees who have to share their office with more than two people experience high levels of colleague distrust and form fewer co-worker friendships than those working in single-occupancy offices ...
</blockquote>

or [this](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/08/19/the-supposed-benefits-of-open-plan-offices-do-not-outweigh-the-costs/) reporting [published research](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2013.06.007):<blockquote>"...the open-plan proponents' argument that open-plan improves morale and productivity appears to have no basis in the research literature."</blockquote>
