I'm still chasing up peer review of data. My it's hard to find anything useful in the peer reviewed literature on the subject, or indeed on the wider Internet ...

<blockquote>With the proliferation of new forms of scholarship, it is no longer effective to teach our students that there is such a thing as reliable literature. There is uncertainty in every information source ...
</blockquote>

It would be helpful if even (or maybe ESPECIALLY) the raw data came with information that would help assess it's reliability and uncertainty ...
