This web site is now running a very slightly modified rev 166 version
of leonardo. I only had to make a few changes:
* modify my menu page to use the new calendar insert option
* copy my modified wiki04 over top of James ...
* add one line to the page template to get an image
* copied my version of static.py (which handles a few more mime types and
slightly different default file locations) over top of the svn version.
* fix a whole heap of bugs in my wiki code. (A revised version is
at [corewiki.tgz](/assets/misc/2005-02-12-leonardo-corewiki.tgz)).

At this stage I haven't yet had a chance to test all the functionality
of my new latex wiki code, as I have yet to install dvi2bitmap
or source-highlight ...
