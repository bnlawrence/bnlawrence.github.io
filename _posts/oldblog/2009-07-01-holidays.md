So, I've been quiet. That's what happens when you go on holiday, where the electrons don't go ...
camping in the "[Doone Valley](http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/outdoors/walks/lorna_doone.shtml)" for three nights, followed by six nights "on the beach" in Hayle.

A flavour of the time:

Down the left: the  valley itself (we camped a few hundred yards or so down the river
from that point), an Exmoor poney near [Dunkery Beacon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkery_Beacon), and an image to remind me
of the night cold - and the beauty of real fire.

Down the right: the beach at Hayle looking towards St Ives, visiting the [Chysauster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chysauster) iron era village, and the night warmth - and the beauty of seaside sunsets.

Haven't been down there in too many years; your photos are a good reminder to go back soon...
