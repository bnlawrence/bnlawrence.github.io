I'm really glad to see that our papers on
* [environmental metadata](htts://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2008.0237) requirements of grids (really service orientated architectures), and
* describing the [deployment of NDG](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2008.0238)

have appeared in the NERC [e-science special edition](http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/mqq743j841hu/?p=780a8ee374e24cfc90593629b239066b&amp;pi=0) of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.
