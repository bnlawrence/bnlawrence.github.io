I have yet to read the paper ([pdf](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2009JCLI2863.1) sub needed), but via [Joe Romm](http://climateprogress.org/2009/05/20/mit-doubles-global-warming-projections-2/) I see that [MIT](http://globalchange.mit.edu/resources/gamble/comparison.html) have just had a new study appear, from which they  apparently (it's not in the paper itself) produced the following figure:

I don't think it much matters whether the details of these roulette wheels are right or not, because I think the general message is: 
* if no policy is enacted we face a climate future from a bunch of really bad outcomes, and
* if some sensible policies are enacted, we might just have a chance of having a climate future for which our children might be able to forgive us, and
* we don't get to choose within these wheels, only between them!
