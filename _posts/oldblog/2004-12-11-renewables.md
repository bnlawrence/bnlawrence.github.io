Not sure one should confess to reading slashdot, but [they](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/12/10/1751253&amp;from=rss)
pointed me to [this](http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/business/2938859) in the Houston Chronicle, basically, the bottom line is that a company ("Green Mountain Energy") is providing **Texan** electricity consumers with electric power from a mix of hydroelectric and wind generation at prices competitive with fossil fuel suppliers!! In Texas of all places. There is hope yet.
