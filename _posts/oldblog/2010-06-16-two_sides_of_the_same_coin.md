Struck by two figures that came by me today (thanks twitter):

[Oil in waves on the beach in Alabama](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/picture/2010/jun/14/bp-oil-spill-oil-spills): ![Image: IMAGE: static/2010/06/16/oil-in-water.jpg ](/assets/images/2010-06-16-oil-in-water.jpg)

[Record breaking warming in October](http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2010/20100615_globalstats.html):

(Both figures degraded in resolution for use on this blog, please follow links to original high definition and for more context.)

Then I drove home and am now going to have a hot shower (diesel + water heated by oil). How can we break the dependency?
