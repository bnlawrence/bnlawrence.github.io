Today I attended a workshop "on "Towards Integrated Knowledge Management", organised as part of a [DEFRA](http://www.defra.gov.uk) horizons scanning project. These horizon projects are meant to give DEFRA a chance (!) of being ready for the next environmental crisis, instead of always being in reactive mode. A totally laudable aim.

I was taken with both the number of people there, and the evident belief of some of them that it was possible to guess what questions could be answered (let alone asked of) by a knowledge management system in twenty years time.  

While some things should be taken for read: the systems will be more complex, incorporate more provenance, and provide far more context for data, other are not nearly so predictable. In fact, I would argue that the only way to get from now to then (ten+ years), is to improve our existing systems so they are capable of effectively answering todays questions.  Arguably, the questions of tomorrow will be the same as today (which have been the same for a thousand years): how can we make our homes safer, improve our own lives without exploiting others, and give our children a better future?  However, no one can predict what technology we'll have in ten years time, so the very best we can do is take incremental steps from where we are now and we'll get there ... so we need to concentrate on maximising the amount of contextural data we store with our data and on interoperability. If we do that, avoid Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and ownership issues, then we'll be on the right path.

I hope this leads to modular service orientated architectures, with published standards compliant data structures underpinning them, and populated with as much data and metadata as possible. Such systems should be built around the communities of existing users, and not central monoliths. However, I fear an over engineered centralised approach ... If only governments would spend as much on acquiring and managing data as they do on poorly defined software projects.
