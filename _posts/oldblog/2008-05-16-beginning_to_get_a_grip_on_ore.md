This Friday afternoon I was trying to get to the bottom of [ORE](http://www.openarchives.org/ore/datamodel). ORE is pretty much defined in RDF and lots of accompanying text. I've been trying to find a way of boiling down the essence of it.  UML (at least as I use it) doesn't quite do the job, so this is the best I could do:

The next step is to look through the [atom implementation documentation](http://www.openarchives.org/ore/0.3/atom-implementation).
