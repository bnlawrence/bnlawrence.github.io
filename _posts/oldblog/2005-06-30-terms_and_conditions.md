[eliterate librarian](http://www.eliteratelibrarian.com/blog/2005/06/20/licensing-digital-information/) has drawn my attention to the [LexisNexis](http://www.lexisnexis.com/) website and their terms and conditions, which are a joke.

The implication that I can be bound by terms and conditions which I have not read (although actually I have in this case, but am ignoring), is as, I say, a joke. Our legal experts tell us that if you want a disclaimer to hold, it has to be **obvious**. Here is what my browser shows me of the LexisNexis web site is this:

the point being that unless I scroll down, I wont see the terms and conditions link, and even if I do, would I assume I have to read it before I could link to any part of their website? Very unlikely. The terms and conditions that eliterate librarian highlights, and you can go laugh at, are useless ... (at least in UK law ... while it is a dangerous assumption, I assume US law is just as sensible about holding people to contracts they haven't seen)!
