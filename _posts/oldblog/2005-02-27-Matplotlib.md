In my last post, I produced a figure of temperature data. As an exercise in learning something new, I produced it with python and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net). I have to say I was pretty impressed with matplotlib. Although I only played
with the tkinter gui and the postscript and png backends, it looks like
there are lots of other interesting output types including SVG. I'm certainly going to play with it some more.
