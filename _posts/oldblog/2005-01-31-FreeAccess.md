From [JISC](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/index.cfm?name=free_access_to_university_research_news171204):<blockquote>The University of Southampton is to make all its academic and scientific research output freely available. A decision by the University to provide core funding for its Institutional Repository establishes it as a central part of its research infrastructure, marking a new era for Open Access to academic research in the UK. The repository provides a publications database with full text, multimedia and research data.

Of course, they aren't really putting all their data out there ... as usual the university has no idea how much data they really have ...
