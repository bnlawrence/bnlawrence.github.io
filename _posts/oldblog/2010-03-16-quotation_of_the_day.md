[Hankin et al](http://www.oceanobs09.net/plenary/files/draft%20papers/pphankin-singleColumn.pdf) at [OceanObs09](http://www.oceanobs09.net/):<blockquote>Today we find remarkable agreement on expectations for vastly improved ocean data management a decade from now -- capabilities that will help to bring significant benefits to ocean research and to society.
Advancing data management to such a degree, however, will require cultural and policy changes that are
slow to effect. The technological foundations upon which data management systems are built are certain to
continue advancing rapidly in parallel. These considerations argue for adopting attitudes of pragmatism
and realism when planning data management strategies.
</blockquote>

Take out the word "ocean" and the rest is true for us all: cultural and policy changes, pragmatism etc ... the technology is the easy part.
