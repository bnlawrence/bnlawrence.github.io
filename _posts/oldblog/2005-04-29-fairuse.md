One of the things I want to do with my blog is often cite research articles, and I often want to include a figure or text from those articles. There is obviously then an issue of copyright that I need to address.

There are no real guidelines[^1] on what to do, but I plan to do the following unless I find that I'm doing wrong:

* I will always cite the original article.
* I will never quote a substantial part of any article.
* When reusing figures from any article protected by copyright I'll degrade[^2] them in some way, e.g. lower the resolution or remove legend and/or axis information) to encourage readers
of my blog to go to the original article if they want to refer to it or use it themselves.

I hope that in this way I will remain within the fair use criteria ... 
[as usual]({% post_url oldblog/2005-03-24-jisc_digital_rights_meeting %}) with these things I wont really know if this is fair use unless someone objects and claims it isn't. It does seem fair to me.

[^1]: Although [this](http://www.someareboojums.org/blog/?p=23) makes a fair stab at it albeit that I understand there is no copyright on US government documents.

[^2]: Given everything is protected by copyright, I'll only invoke this where the reader would normally not have public access to the document, i.e. a subscription would be required to otherwise have access to it.
