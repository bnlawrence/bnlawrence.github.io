[In April]({% post_url 2018-04-12-workload %}) I reported my first couple of months of workload anlaysis using the [timing app](https://timingapp.com). I've now done three more months, so was interested to look at how I'd done.

A couple of conclusions from last time were that:
* I needed to spend *much* more time on academic reading and writing. Ideally that would be around 20% with the remainder of my university time spent on admin and supervising project work etc, and
* Given I averaged a 58 working week, I wanted to work a bit less and to try and get closer to a 50 hour week.

I didn't actively monitor either of these things during the period, although I did conciously try to work less at weekends, and ignore a few deadlines in favour of reading and writing ... (on the principle that much of what is _urgent_ is not in fact _important_, and they teach you on time management courses to try and ignore the siren call of _urgency_ unless it is _important_!)

So how did I do?

The headlines suggest rather well:
* Over the three months, allowing for holidays etc, I was on 49.8 hours per 5 working day week, which is as close to 50 as you'd like, given I wasn't monitoring time directly!
* We will see that I was around 20% on academic reading and writing which again was pretty good.

Now the issue for the next quarter is can I keep that up?

The other two pieces of analysis I did were around what applications I used, and a more detailed look at the balance between my responsibilities.

#### Applications

Firstly, the pie chart shows where I have spent most of my time over the last quarter, at least in terms of time at the keyboard of my Mac:

It's kind of fun to compare with last time, so we will:

| App | Q2 Rank| Q1 Rank | Q2% | Q1% |
| --- | ------:| -------:| ---:| ---:|
| Chrome | 1 | 2 | 11.5% | 15..2% |
| Mail | 2 | 1 | 10.4% | 15.3% |
| Slack | 3 | 4 | 7.1% | 5.2% |
| TeXstudio | 4 | 5 | 6.5% | 4.6 % |
| MacDown | 5 | x | 4.7% | x |
| Preview | 6 | mention | 3.8% | x |
| PyCharm | 7 | 6 | 3.2% | 4.2% |
| LibreOffice | 8 | 9 | 2.5% | 9 |
| Fusion | 9 | 8 | 2.5% | 3.0% |
| PowerPoint | 10 | x | 1.6% | x |
| Word | x | 3 | x | 5.6% |
| Atom | x | 7 | x | 3.2% |


(*Pycharm appears twice in the stats, which is why it's out of order with respect to the figure, I guess two different versions were recorded, but I obviously summed them here.)

What can we conclude from this:
1. I still spend most of my time in the browser and mail ... (_Chrome_ and _MailPlane_  -- I pretty much ditched _Airmail_, it kept chewing up CPU).
2. This quarter I had more time for interacting with my team and NCAS colleagues (_Slack_).
3. Last quarter I spent more time working on external collaboration documents (_Word_), with nearly no use of it  this quarter (since I wasn't forced into it ...)
4. The foreshadowed migration from _Atom_ to _MacDown_ for Markdown editing was nearly total!
5. Apparently when I am reading and working on papers I clearly read a lot of presentations (_PowerPoint_), read/annotate a lot of documents (_Preview_), use _TeXstudio_ a lot, as well as _LibreOffice_ (for diagrams).
6. _PyCharm_ and _Fusion_ remain important for doing real work ... (i.e fun things like programming for plots etc).
7. (Not in the table, but the advent of _HouhdahSpot_ for searching knocked _Finder_ down a little bit, and I think has made a real difference for quickly finding material.

As last time, honourable mentions go to: _Evernote_ and _Nozbe_, and don't forget the caveat that I think these statistics record where the mouse and keyboard focus lay, but with a big monitor (sometimes two), I clearly have and use lots of simultaneously open windows from multiple applications. My focus may well differ from the pointer!

#### What was I doing?

Using the same methodology as last time -  noting that I spent roughly 13% of my time in "overheads" (unassigned email, time management, computing environment etc) - which we distribute amongst the assigned activities, we get:

* NCAS general management (meetings, staff and financial management, running the Models and Data division, providing HPC support to NERC, looking after JASMIN)
    * 57% (actual, 74% of a 40h week). (The target is 60%, last time it was 54/63).
    * Within that JASMIN consumed 16/21% of my time, and direct support (advice/representation) for NERC HPC _on top_ of JASMIN support an additional 7.8/10.1%).
* Academic Reading and Writing (reading being defined as reading done that wasn't necessary for a specific task):
    * Reading 1.7/2.2 (cf 0.8/1.1 last time)
    * Writing 18.6/24 (cf 2.8/3.3 last time)
* Working on the ESIWACE1 project in some way:
    * 13.8/17.9 (last time I was mainly working on ESIWACE2, which was 9.2/10.9)

These are again in the right ball park for my various responsibilities, although JASMIN + HPC workload ought to be nearer 20 than 30% of my time.

#### Conclusions

Some conclusions from all of this? Pretty pleased that my default juggling of time seems to be giving the right outcomes both in terms of my various responsibilities, and a more sensible work/life balance.

It will be interesting to see how the [advent of the IPAD]({% post_url 2018-07-02-ipad %}) affects these various percentages, either because I can't measure things as well (more time on the IPAD) or some activities get moved from the Mac to the Ipad (or not).
