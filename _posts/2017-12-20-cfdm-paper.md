It's always a nice present for any academic when a paper finally appears "in print". After some months in public review, our paper introducing a formal data model for the Climate Forecast (CF) conventions {% cite HasEA17 %} has appeared in _Geoscientific Model Development_. Although CF was developed for content stored in NetCDF files, this data model has been developed in such a way that the logic can be used for CF content stored in other formats.
