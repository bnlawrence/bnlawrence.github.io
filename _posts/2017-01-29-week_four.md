Not much to report for week four, since the work I did this week was mostly "processing email" - although we did submit the outline EPSRC bid, so one thing actually done (for now). The lack of anything else substantial was down to still being in the States in the early part of the week, coupled with a virulent bout of (probably) food poisoning which knocked me out for a couple of days.
