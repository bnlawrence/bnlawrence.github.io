    <p>Getting Things Done. GTD.</p>

<p>My colleague <a href="http://ncas-climate.nerc.ac.uk/~ericg/">Eric Guilyardi</a> showed me <a href="http://www.pagico.com">Pagico</a> on Friday. I was sufficiently impressed that I spent a few hours on Saturday morning playing with it.</p>

<p>Why? Well, I’m continually feeling hassled by the number of things that I’m trying to keep track of, the size of my inbox etc, so a good GTD tool has always been something I’ve been looking for.</p>

<p>Years ago I used <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a> (successfully, for some months, but in the end it it couldn’t deal with the complexity of information I wanted to store in it). I’ve used a range of notes tools, and I’m currently using <a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a>. I use it for everything of course, but for GTD, I just use a weekly to-do list with check boxes, but it doesn’t organise things … and I find I ignore the reminders … so is there something better out there?</p>

<p>Well, Pagico on Eric’s screen certainly looked like it. I particularly liked the someday tasks, that show up for tomorrow. I liked the “dashboard” (pseudo-Gantt) … and when I read about it I liked the idea of Evernote and email integration. So, as i said, I spent some hours with it. Of course, in doing so, I did a bit of googling… and started wondering whether Pagico was really what I want.</p>

<p>However, meanwhile, in just trying to work out how to use Pagico, I did some <strong>really useful thinking</strong> about how to organise my workflow into task lists, tasks, projects and collections. I (manually) moved a bunch of emails into Pagico (and archived them in Gmail). I archived everything else. I achieved inbox zero for the first time in, well, it seems like forever (certainly at least a year). The lesson I take from that particular exercise is that the “organise” part of GTD is incredibly important, and probably independent of the tool (provided it has at least three levels of hierarchy).</p>

<p>Experience with Pagico itself? Well, I had some little glitches I didn’t like, so on Saturday I wrote to the developer. On Sunday I had a reply, I replied, he replied. Blimey, that’s responsive (and I made it clear I was only using the trial version and might not buy). Sounds like he’ll fix some of the things I didn’t like/wanted. Blimey again.</p>

<p>At this point I have a lot of actions in a few projects. We’ll see how the week goes, but I’m already a bit disappointed in that the evernote integration is weak - one only gets to drag a web-link in, so it doesn’t work with native (mac[^1](/computing/2014/08/building_your_own_jasmin_virtual_machine/). But I have to confess, for management gubbins, I do like the Mac. Damn it. Worse, nowadays, management gubbins is most of my day job, which is why the blogging has dried up. Damn it again.  Oh, and I have to say, the macbook hardware is <strong>really</strong> good too!]) application I use. Also, my email is in gmail. I haven’t found a way of marking an email as a task, or how to drag an email into Pagico. For me that’s absolutely crucial. I suppose I could load gmail into the Mac email app (from where d&amp;d apparently works), but I am rather partial to google’s filtering into priority inbox etc … (but maybe I don’t need that with a good GTD tool).</p>

<p>So, just this few hours of playing with Pagico has made me realise that: I do need a really good GTD tool, even the thinking that this GTD tool made me do was useful, but it needs evernote, email and calendar integration. Oh, and it has to have a good android interface on phone and tablet. Will it be Pagico, or will it be something else?</p>

<p>As I said above, I did some googling, and in doing so  I discovered that the whole GTD world has moved on <strong>a lot</strong> since I last paid attention. <a href="http://purplezengoat.com">purplezengoat</a>, for example, has a <a href="http://purplezengoat.com/2013/10/22/ten-great-apps-for-getting-things-done/">very interesting list</a> of tools to think about. I intend to think about them, possibly concentrating on iqtell and zendone.  But I’m going to give Pagico a week. Stay tuned.

Yes, I sold my soul and moved to a macbook about six months ago, but never fear, i only do management gubbins on it, my real work is done on a [linux virtual machine</p>

Bryan, I use Gmail via the MacMail app (using IMAP), but it doesn’t stop me using Gmail via native web interface when I need to. Would that work?</p>

<p><em>Bryan (on Monday 26 January, 2015)</em>
Hi Chris. Thanks.  Indeed that’s an option … but I’ve done a bit more since I wrote that. It turns out that the drag’n’drop from mac mail doesn’t really do what I want either. I’ll write it up at the end of the week.</p>
